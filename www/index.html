  * The "meta viewport" tag (below) helps your app size appropriately to a device's ideal viewport.
  * Note that Windows device viewports work better when initialized using the @viewport CSS rule.
  * For a quick overview of "meta viewport" and @viewport, see this article:
  *   http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/quick-tip-dont-forget-the-viewport-meta-tag
  * To see how it works, try your app on a real device with and without a "meta viewport" tag.

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ayella Hanna Christine Mendoza."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kumunot ang noo ni Hanna habang nakatitig siya sa itim na envelop na nakalagay sa table sa loob ng cubicle niya. Umagang-umaga iyon at wala pang tao sa opisina nila kundi siya lamang. Talagang inagahan niya ang
                                            pasok dahil Lunes nang araw na iyon at hindi niya gusto ang ma-traffic. Pasimpleng dinampot niya ang envelop at saka ibinaba ang coffee cup na hawak niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ano ito? Bakit itim ang sobre?" Ayaw pa sana niyang hawakan ang sobreng iyon. Naisip kasi niya na baka anthrax ang laman niyon. Sa linya ng trabaho niya, hindi malabong mangyari iyon. Isa siyang investigative news
                                            writer. Nagtatrabaho siya sa isa sa pinakamalaking network sa buong bansa at kilala na rin ang pangalan niya sa industriya. Writer siya at hindi reporter ngunit palaging napapasabak ang pangalan niya sa tuwing
                                            may expose na inilalabas ang news show na kinabibilangan niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Pinakatitigan niya ang sobre. Naka-engrave ang pangalan niya sa likod nito. Hindi kaya death threat ang laman noon? Napailing siya at saka naisip na kailangan niyang buksan ang sobreng iyon. Kung ikamamatay niya
                                            ang nasa loob noon, bahala na at least nakarating na siya sa punto ng buhay niya na masasabi niyang may contribution na siya sa mundo.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She opened it and she smiled when she read what was inside that envelop. It was an invitation for their homecoming reunion. Napalabi siya. Reunion? Gaano na ba katagal mula nang huli niyang makahalubilo ang mga
                                            kaklase niya? Hindi na niya matandaan at ayaw na rin naman niyang alalahanin. Wala siyang masyadong magandang alaala noong nasa high school siya. Hell ang high school life niya. At hindi na sana niya gustong
                                            balikan ang parte na iyon ng kanyang buhay.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hanna ang aga mo naman." Ngumiti siya nang marinig niya ang boses ni Keir Dann. Kier Dann was one of their renowned reporters inside that TV station at hindi lang iyon. Nanliligaw rin ito sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Flowers for you..." Nakangiting tinangigap niya iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Thanks. And good morning." She stared at the bouquet of flowers Keir Dann gave her. Hindi niya talaga maintindihan kung bakit pero sa tagal na nanliligaw sa kanya ni Kier Dann ay wala talaga siyang nararamdaman
                                            para dito kundi platonic love at ang kaya lang niyang ialok sa lalaking ito ay walang iba kundi friendship lang.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Invitation? Para saan?" tukoy pa nito sa hawak niyang envelop.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Class reunion." Matipid niyang sagot. Naupo siya sa swivel chair at saka in-on ang laptop niya. She needs to start working now, act like she's very busy so that Kier Dann would go away.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Pupunta ka?" muling tanong nito. She sighed.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi ko pa alam. Kapag hindi busy."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Do you have a plus one?" tanong pa nito. Umiling siya. Hindi na siya makatiis at tiningnan na niya si Kier.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Even if I have a plus one hindi kita aayain. I don't want to be rude pero you know naman where I stand with all this panliligaw of yours diba?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hindi nakasagot si Keir, tahimik itong umalis at iniwan siya. Napailing siyang muli. Hindi naman niya gustong maging bastos kaya lang ay hindi na niya matiis. Minsan ay sinusungitan na niya ng bongga si Keir pero
                                            hindi pa rin siya nito tinitigilan. Hindi naman sa ayaw niya kay Kier pero sa tingin niya ay hindi sila bagay na dalawa. Alam niyang kaya lang siya nililigawan nito ay dahil sa hitsura niya. Hindi naman sa nagbubuhat
                                            siya ng bangko ngunit maganda siya. She got the face of someone that could make Marian Rivera run out of money. Maganda siya. Ang nanay at ang mga kapatid niya ay dating beauty queen. Her mother was a former
                                            Miss Universe while her sisters both joined Mutya ng Pilipinas at parehong may nauwing title ang mga ito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Pero hindi tulad ng mga kapatid niya at nanay. Hindi siya totoong maganda. Nito lang naman siya gumanda, noong panahong nakialam ang mga ate niya at ginawa siya "project."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Back when she was still in high school, in her adolescence stage, hindi siya ang Hanna na Hanna ngayon na 34-24-26. Ang Hanna noon ay 36-36-36. Bilog siya. Kumbaga sa hitsura Betty La Fea meets the biggest loser.
                                            May bakal siya sa bibig, may salamin at malaki ang katawan. Same reason kung bakit wala siyang fond memory noong high school siya. She spent the last four years of her life as a high school student, living inside
                                            of her shell. Hell ang high school niya. She was always being made fun of. Laughing stock siya ng mga popular kids noon. Madalas siya mabato ng binilot na papel at madalas din siyang mabinyagan ng iba't-ibang
                                            pangalan.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Freaky Hanna.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Dirty Hanna.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hanna Baboy. At kung anu-ano pa.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Ayos na sana ang mga iyon. Hindi naman kasi siya masyadong nasasaktan pero hindi rin siya talaga pinalampas ng mga kaklase niya noon. Ang pinaka matinding pambu-bully na naranasan niya ay noong prom night nila.
                                            At lahat ng iyon ay pasimuno ng animal na iyon na hanggang ngayon sa tuwing maiisip niya ang mukha ay kumukulo pa rin ang dugo niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hanna!" nag-angat siya ng tingin nang marinig ang boses ng isang babae. She saw Menchie standing in front of her cubicle. Takang-taka itong nakatingin sa mga kamay niya. "Ano na namang iniisip mo at nabali iyang
                                            lapis na hawak mo?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Tiningnan niya ang lapis na hawak niya. Tama si Menchie, naputol nga niya ang lapis sa gitna.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Iniisip mo na naman iyong nam-bully sa'yo noon?" tanong nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi! Bakit ko iisipin iyon?" nakasimangot na tugon niya. Ibinaling niya ang kanyang mga mata sa laptop sa kanyang harapan. Pilit niyang iwinawaglit sa kanyang isipan ang mukha ng hudas na lalaking naging dahilan
                                            ng most embarrassing moment niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hanggang ngayon kapag naaalala niya ang nakakaasar na mukha ng hudas na iyon ay kumukulo ang dugo niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>

Bulong niya habang pilit binabasa ang article na kailangan niyang pag-aralan. Pasasaan ba at makakaganti rin siya sa Antonio Kerkmez na iyon - ang lalaking may malaking
                                            kasalanan sa kanya.</p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Masayang-masaya si Kerky habang tinititigan ang pangalan niya sa likod ng itim na sobreng kanina lang niya natanggap. Kanina niya pa iyon pinaglalaruan sa kanyang mga kamay habang palakad-lakad siya sa hallway ng
                                            Revert records - ang recording company ng banda nila. He's in a band called The Pastels and they were just starting out in the industry. Pero kahit ganoon ay masasabi na niya na may binabat na ang banda niya
                                            kung ikukumpara sa iba. Apat sila sa banda. Si Caleb - the front man, Calen - lead guitars, Lex, - the drummer at siya - ang bassist. Hindi na nga niya maalala kung gaano na sila katagal magkakasama ng mga kaibigan
                                            niya. Basta ang natatandaan na lamang niya nagsimula ang lahat sa isang disastrous prom night when he was sixteen years old at nang matapos ang gabing iyon he could say that they made history.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Lex!" sigaw niya nang makita niya si Lex na papasok sa conference room. Huminto ito at sinalubong siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bok." Bati nito sa kanya. Tinapik niya ang balikat nito at saka pinakita ang envelop na hawak niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Meron ka na nito?" nakatawang tanong niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Yup, I received mine this morning." Sagot nito habang naglalakad papasok sa conference room. Sinabayan niya ang paglakad nito. "</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Are you coming? Ako I'm excited." Tuloy-tuloy lamang ang kanilang paglakad. Nang makapasok sa loob ay agad na inukopa ni Lex ang paborito nitong upuan.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Why are you excited?" nakangising tanong ng kaibigan niya. "Hindi ka ba natatakot?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Biglang kumunot ang noo niya. Bakit siya matatakot? Saan siya matatakot? Ang alam niya reunion ang pupuntahan, hindi hazing. Anong dapat niyang ikatakot? Itatanong sana niya iyon kay Lex nang biglang bumukas ang
                                            pinto. Iniluwa noon si Calen at si Caleb na kasunod naman si Ian.</p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">His initial reaction upon seeing Ian was to smile. But then he reminded himself that Ian was off-limits. Hindi sila pwede. Kahit na anong gawin niya malunod man si Ian sa nararadaman niya para dito ay hindi sila
                                            pwede dahil si Ian ay para kay Robi - we'll that was another story.</p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ready saan? May burol ba?" tugon ni Lex habang nakatingin ka Calen na itim na itim ang suot.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Rika wanted to see you. It could only mean two things. It's either may issue ang isa sa inyo or, hit ang single ninyo and I am praying and hoping na iyong pangalawa ang dahilan at nandito kayo."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Nananakot ka pa, Ian eh." Reklamo niya habang nakatingin kay Ian. She smiled at him. Napabuntong hininga siya. Kaysarap makita ng mga ngiting iyon. Ang problema lang ay hindi para sa kanya ang mga ngiting iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi kaya." Ian made a face. "Teka, tatawagin ko na si Rika." Tumalikod ito at saka lumabas sa pinto. Sinundan niya ito ng tingin. Napapabuntong hininga na naupo siya at saka yumuko. Sayang. Kung nakilala niya
                                            lang sana si Ian sa ibang pagkakataon at ibang panahon marahil ay pwede sila.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Uy! Broken hearted!" pang-aasar sa kanya ni Calen. He looked at his friend and made a face.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi ah. Pero, siyempre nanghihinayang pa rin ako." Iyon ang totoo. Noon talaga ay balak niyang ligawan si Ian, pero hindi natuloy dahil kay Robi. He respects the man so much that he couldn't bear making him his
                                            competition at sa isa pa wala siyang laban sa forever.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Teka, pag-usapan natin itong reunion. Wala pa naman si Rika." Pilit niyang iniiba ang usapan. Iwinagayway niya ang sobre at saka tiningnan ang tatlo niyang kaharap.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Pupunta ba tayo?" tanong ni Calen.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ako pupunta. Ewan ko sa inyo."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Wow! Ang lakas ng loob!" sigaw ni Caleb. Napatingin siya sa kanyang kaibigan. Calen and Caleb share the same face, the same height but they differ in their personalities. Calen was the mischievous one while Caleb
                                            was the serious silent type of guy.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"At bakit naman ganyan ang reaction ninyo?" taking-takang tanong niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bok, baka nakakalimutan mo na may naiwan kang atraso sa isa sa mga batch mates natin."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kumunot ang kanyang noo. He rested his back at the chair and looked at his band mates. Kanino siya may naiwang atraso? Parang hindi naman niya maintindihan. Ano bang sinasabi ng mga ito?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bok, he doesn't remember," wika ni Calen. Siniko naman siya ni Lex.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Freaky Hanna," dahan-dahan niyang nilingon si Lex. His mouth fell as the image of a chubby teenage girl covered with slime and mud flashed on his brain.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Freaky Hanna. Two words that he tried forgetting about pero ngayon naisip niya na hindi niya pala kayang basta kalimutan ang babaeng iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Sa tingin ninyo galit pa rin siya sa akin?" mahinang tanong niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi na." Calen said. Kahit paano ay nakahinga siya ng maluwag. Siguro ay tama si Calen. Ilan taon na ba ang lumipas? Halos ten years na rin ang dumaan mula nang mangyari ang insidenteng iyon noong prom night.
                                            Siguro naman ay napatawad na siya ni Freaky Hanna.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi na siguro galit iyon noh?" nakangiting sabi niya. Tumango naman si Lex.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi galit iyon. Malamang kinasusuklaman ka noon." Litanya ni Calen.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Siguro, sinubukan ka ring ipakulam noon." Dagdag pa ni Lex.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"At, kung nagkaroon ng pagkakataon, malamang ipina-assassinate ka na noon. Pinabaril sa ulo o kaya man pina-salvage sa mga frat na kakilala niya."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Pero, bok," hinawakan ni Calen ang braso niya. "Opinyon lang naman namin iyon. Hindi pa naman namin siya nakakausap o kung anuman."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kaya wag kang matakot. Malay mo kapag nagkita kayo ni Hanna eh yakapin ka noon," wika ni Lex.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Yakapin ka sabay saksak sa tagiliran. Pak!" muling pang-aasar ni Caleb.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Tahimik na inirapan niya ang mga ito. Nag-iisip siya. Kung tutuusin ay hindi lang naman siya ang may kasalanan sa nangyari noon. He had his share of fault. Pero hindi naman pwedeng isisi sa kanya ang lahat. Siguro
                                            ang kasalanan niya lang ay ang sinabi niya rito ang mga bagay na alam niyang dapat ay hindi lumabas sa kanyang bibig. Marahil ay iyon ang pinakamalaking kamaliang ginawa niya. Pero other than that, wala na siyang
                                            ibang ginawa.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hindi lang dapat sa kanya ituon ang sisi.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Wala naman na siguro sa kanya iyon." Biglang naiusal niya. Tumingin siya kay Lex.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bok, sa tingin mo hanggang ngayon galit sa akin si Hanna?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi ko alam. Wala na akong naging balita sa kanya after noong graduation."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Seriously, the last time I heard, she had undergone plastic surgery." Sabi pa ni Calen. Napatingin siya sa kaibigan.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"At saan mo naman nalaman iyan?" tanong niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Sa ex mo." Itinaas baba ni Calen ang kanyang mga kilay.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kay Sandy?" hindi makapaniwalang tanong niya. "Paano mo - " hindi na niya naituloy ang sasabihin dahil biglang bumukas ang pinto ng conference room at iniluwa noon si Rika. She was smiling ear to ear.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Congratulations, The Pastels! Your album sales are up. Your single, I don't wanna know why, is number one in the charts! I'm so happy for you guys!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Bigla ay nakadama siya ng tuwa. Napatayo siya at saka niyakap si Rika. Sumunod na rin ang mga kabanda niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Group hug!" sigaw ng kung sino habang yakap-yakap nila si Rika.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Can't breathe!" reklamo nito maya-maya. Isa-isang lumayo sila kay Rika at pinalibutan ito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bok, sikat na tayo!" sabi niya kay Lex.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ano ka? Matagal ka ng sikat! Ngayon mo lang nararamdaman!" wika ni Caleb.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Masaya siya. Masaya talaga. Unti-unti na niyang nakikita ang katuparan ng kanilang mga pangarap. Masarap pala sa pakiramdam. Ngunit sa kabila noon, hindi niya mawaglit sa isipan niya ang mukha ng isang babaeng nagngangalang
                                            Ayella Hanna Christine Mendoza a.k.a. Freaky Hanna.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Mohawk!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Awtomatikong gumuhit ang ngiti sa mukha ni Kerky nang marinig niya ang pangalang iyon. Isang tao lang ang tumatawag sa kanya ng ganoon at hindi siya maaaring magkamali. Agad na nilingon niya ang pinanggalingan ng
                                            tinig.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Jenny!" sigaw niya nang makita itong papalapit sa kanya. Jenny used to work for Neon - she used to be Trey's personal assistant but she was now Trey's girlfriend.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Mukhang napaaga ka, wala pa iyong boyfriend mo." Biro niya rito nang makalapit sa kanya. Kasalukuyan silang nasa loob ng cafeteria. Naupo si Jenny sa kanyang harapan at saka pinagmasdan siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Amoy five-hundred ka na naman." Kumindat ito. "Balita ko may bonus ka ah. Libre mo naman ako!" ungot nito sa kanya. Tatawa-tawang napailing siya. He had known this girl for a year and a half now, pero hindi pa
                                            rin siya immune sa pagpapatawa nito. Suddenly the memory of their first meeting flashed inside his brain. Hanggang ngayon kapag naiisip niya ang nangyari noong nakilala niya si Jenny ay natatawa pa rin siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Wag na. Sasapakin na ako ng boyfriend mo." Biro niya rito.</p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"At bakit ka sasapakin ni Trey?" nagtatakang tanong nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Diba nga nagseselos siya sa akin?" pabulong na sabi niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ungas! Bakit magseselos sa'yo iyon, eh ang gwapo-gwapo ng Trey ko?! Iyong ka-gwapuhan niya lagpas sa building na ito! Grabeh! Maisip ko pa lang siya kinikilig na ako!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"So hindi ako gwapo?" tanong niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi! Yuck!" Jenny made a face. Sinipa naman niya ang paa nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Aray!" napangiwi ito sa sakit. "Uy, Kokey alam mo masama iyan." Nakangusong sabi nito sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Anong masama?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Iyan. Iyong gumagawa ka ng bad thing sa kapwa mo. Sabi nila kapag nakagawa ka ng masama sa isang tao, maji-jinx ka," seryosong pahayag ni Jenny.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Anong jinx?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You know..." nagkibit balikat pa ito. "Hangga't hindi ka nakakahingi ng tawad sa taong nagawan mo ng masama dadalhin mo ang galit niya sa'yo habambuhay. Ang tendency, hindi mo mahahanap ang totoong happiness mo."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Napaawang ang mga labi niya. Jinx? Habambuhay na pagdadala ng galit? Ang hindi makatagpo ng tunay na kaligayahan? Pinakatitigan niya si Jenny na sa pagkakataong iyon ay nakatingin lamang din sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bakit ganyan ang hitsura mo? Siguro may ginawa kang masama sa isang tao noon at hanggang ngayon ay hindi ka nakakapag-sorry noh?" inosenteng tanong ni Jenny sa kanya. Bigla ay napatayo siya. Inisip niya ang mangilan-ngilang
                                            insidente sa buhay niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Ang hindi niya pagkakaroon ng magandang relasyon sa kanyang ina.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Ang nararamdaman niyang emptiness palagi kapag nasa isang relasyon siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Ang maling pagkakataon ng pagkakakilala niya kay Ian.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">At ang iba pang kamalasan sa buhay niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi maaari!" usal niya. May kinalaman ba ang lahat ng iyon sa ginawa niya kay Freaky Hanna almost ten years ago?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kung meron, ang ibig sabihin, long overdue na ang forgiveness na noon pa niya dapat hiningi kay Freaky Hanna.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Mabilis siyang kumilos. Agad niyang nilisan ang cafeteria at kahit naririnig niya si Jenny na tinatawag siya ay hindi niya iyon pinansin. Kailangan niyang mahanap si Lex o si Calen o si Caleb. Kailangan niyang manghingi
                                            ng payo. Kailangan niyang harapin ang katotohanan na may posibilidad na kaya nagkakamalas-malas ang ilang aspeto ng kanyang buhay ay dahil sa katotohanan na baka hanggang ngayon ay konektado pa rin ang lahat
                                            kay Freaky Hanna. And as much as possible, ayaw na niya ng koneksyon sa babaeng iyon. Masyado nang matagal ang sampung taon para maging koentado sila sa isa't-isa.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Calen!" sigaw niya nang mamataan si Calen sa loob ng men's room. Sinundan niya ito papasok.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Calen--- shit!" he cursed when he saw his friend Calen making out with some girl inside the men's room. "Really, Cal? Inside the men's room?" sarkastikong tanong niya. Tumigil ang dalawa. Calen smiled at the woman
                                            and asked her to leave. Matapos iyon ay binalingan siya nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Panira ka ng moment eh!" inis na wika ng kaibigan niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bok makinig ka muna! Mahalaga ito!" pahiyag pa niya. "Kailangan nating magpunta sa reunion." Panimula niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Magpunta ka! Hawak ko ba ang paa mo?" inis na sabi nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi! Kailangan nating magpunta talaga doon. Seryoso ako Calen."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Diba nga pupunta nga tayo? Kaya lang hindi sigurado."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kailangan nga nating siguraduhin na pupunta tayo sa reunion." Muling sabi niya. Binalingan siyang muli ni Calen.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi ka talaga natatakot kay Freaky Hanna, ano? Baka mamaya wrestlingin ka noon!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Wala akong pakialam. I need to see her." Matiim na sabi niya. Kunot na kunot ang noo ni Calen habang nakatitig sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bakit?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Manghihingi ako ng tawad." Madamdaming pahayag niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">-----------------------</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hahaha! You're a freak, Hanna! Gullible freak!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hanna stood in the middle of the dance floor covered with slime and mud. Hindi siya makapaniwala sa mga nagaganap. Akala niya katuparan na ng fairytale dream niya. Akala niya totoong magiging prinsesa na siya ngunit
                                            nagkamali siya. Lahat ng ito ay isang patibong upang mahulog na naman siya sa isang kahihiyan. Pinahid niya ang mga luha niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bakit ninyo ba ginagawa sa akin ito?" humihikbing tanong niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Cause you're a freak. Ilusyunada ka! Akala mo magkakagusto talaga si Kerky sa'yo?!" si Sandy ang nagsalita. Tiningnan niya ito. Sa pagkakataong iyon ay nakapalupot na ang mga kamay nito sa braso ni Kerky - ang
                                            lalaking kanina lang ay nagtatapat ng pag-ibig sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kerky will never fall in love with you. Diba, honey?" tiningnan pa nito si Kerky. Napailing siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi." Nanginginig ang boses na wika niya. "Sabi mo mahal mo na ako diba? You said.. you said - "</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Don't believe everything you hear freak." Gumuho ang mundo niya nang marinig niya ang mga salitang iyon na namutawi sa bibig ni Kerky. "Kahit kailan ay hindi ako papatol sa isang tulad mo, freaky Hanna."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Ang sakit. She was only sixteen years old but she already got her heart shattered into million pieces. Hindi pa ba sapat na napahiya siya? Kailangan ba talagang masaktan pa siya ng ganito? Hindi na niya kaya. She
                                            started running away at habang palayo siya sa lugar na iyon ay lalong lumalakas ang halakhak ng mga school mates niya...</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Habang naglalakad si Hanna ay hindi niya mapigilang na maalala ang insidenteng iyon sa kanyang buhay - the night of the prom where she got her ego torn into pieces and her heart broken. Hinding - hindi niya makakalimutan
                                            ang mga taong nanakit sa kanya noong gabing iyon. Napangiti siya. Ano kaya ang sasabihin ng mga taong iyon sa oras na makita nila ang Hanna ngayon? Gustung-gusto niyang makita ang mga mukha nito sa oras na pumasok
                                            siya sa Arellano Hall kung saan gaganapin ang class reunion nila. Sisiguraduhin niya na ngayong gabi, sila naman ang mapapahiya at siya naman ang tatawa nang malakas at ipamumukha kung gaano sila ka-worthless.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Alam niyang mali ang principle niya para sa gabing iyon. Pero hindi rin naman niya kayang sisihin ang kanyang sarili. Ang tagal na panahong ikinahiya niya ang sarili niya sa ibang tao. Ang tagal niyang nagtago.
                                            Pakiramdam kasi niya mula noong gabing iyon ay kasalanan sa lipunan ang maging mataba at pangit. Ang akala niya dahil ganoon ang hitsura niya ay wala na siyang karapatang mabuhay. Mabuti na lang at hindi siya
                                            pinabayaan ng kanyang pamilya. All she needed was a little push and encouragement from her parents and sisters and huwala! The new Hanna was born.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Matagal ang proseso sa muling pagbangon ng bagong Hanna. Hindi madali ang work out, diet at kung anu-ano pang pinagagawa sa kanya ng kanyang mga kapatid. Madalas sabihin sa kanya noong ng kanyang Ate Adriana na
                                            kung walang hapdi walang ganda and it turned out to be true. Sa sobrang daming hapdi at luhang iniiyak niya - matapos ang ilang buwan ay unti-unting nababawasan ang kanyang timbang at makalipas ang isa't kalahating
                                            taon ay nasusuot at nabibili na niya ang mga damit na gusto niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Good evening. Name please." Napatingin siya sa babaeng naka-itim na dress na nakaupo sa likod ng mahabang table malapit sa entrance ng hall.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hanna Mendoza." Sagot niya. Ngumiti ang babae at hinanap ang pangalan niya sa isang kulay pulang libro. Maya-maya ay may ibinigay itong papel sa kanya kung saan nakasulat ang kanyang pangalan. Idinikit niya iyon
                                            sa kanyang damit. May ibinigay ring isang maliit na papel sa kanya kung saan nakasulat naman ang table number niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Thank you." magalang na wika niya sa babae. She took a deep breath before entering the hall. She could hear the music playing loudly inside. Kinakabahan siya. Isang bagay na hindi na niya madalas maramdaman ngayon.
                                            Sa linya kasi ng trabaho niya ay hindi na uso ang salitang kaba.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hinawakan niya ang doorknob. Tatlong beses muna siyang nagbuga ng hangin bago tuluyang binuksan ang pinto. And just like what she thought, sinalubong siya ng ingay ng musika at ingay na nagmumula sa iba't-ibang
                                            table sa loob ng hall. Habang naglalakad siya ay unti-unti na niyang nakikita ang mga pamilyar na mukhang iyon na hindi talaga niya kinalimutan. Napangiti siya nang mapansin niyang ilan sa mga kalalakihan sa
                                            loob ng hall ay sinusundan siya ng tingin. Hindi siya nagbubuhat ng bangko, ngunit sinuguro niya ngayong gabi na maganda talaga siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She was wearing a simple sleeveless black dress. Hanggang tuhod niya lamang ang haba ng damit na iyon. Light lang ang make up niya but she put on an exaggerated red lipstick. She was also wearing her favorite stilettos.
                                            So right now, she could really feel that she was one of the most beautiful women inside the hall.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hinanap niya ang assigned table para sa kanya at nang makita iyon ay tahimik siyang naupo. Wala pang tao sa mesang iyon kundi siya at iniisip niya kung may mauupo pa roon o isa na naman ito sa mga not-so-funny pranks
                                            ng mga butihin niyang kaklase.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Tahimik siyang nagmasid. Marami rin ang dumating sa reunion nila.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Darating kaya ang Kerky na iyon?" bulong niya habang palingon-lingon. Tumaas ang kilay niya nang makita niya ang isang pamilyar na babaeng nakatayo malapit sa bar at nakikipagtawanan. Kung hindi siya nagkakamali
                                            at alam niyang hindi talaga siya mali, si Sandy ang babaeng iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">One down, one to go. Nasaan na kaya ang Kerky na iyon?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Good evening, batch mates!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Lumipat ang tingin niya sa makeshift stage upang sinuhin ang nagsalita sa mic. Pamilyar rin sa kanya ang mukha ng taong iyon. If she remember it right, Calen ang pangalan ng lalaki or was it Caleb? Hindi siya sigurado.
                                            Then only thing she was sure of was that the man in front of the microphone has a twin brother.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"We are The Pastels and we're going to color your world!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Matapos sabihin ang mga salitang iyon ay sumunod ang nakabibinging tunog ng drums - a moment later the guys on the stage were making harmonious music together. And she was enjoying it. Napapangiti na siya nang biglang
                                            may mahagip ang kanyang mga mata. Her smile froze as she recognized the man standing on that stage, holding a guitar and posing that funny Mohawk</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">He was no other than Antonio Harvey Kerkmez.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">---------------------</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Maputol iyang leeg mo, Kerky."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Biglang bumigat ang mga balikat ni Kerky dahil sa pag-akbay na ginawa ni Lex. He looked at his friend. Hawak nito sa kanang kamay ang isang baso ng scotch. Clearly he was having the time of his life. Luminga muli
                                            siya at natanaw naman niya si Calen na may kausap na tatlong babaeng pamilyar sa kanya ngunit wala siyang panahon para alalahanin. Binalingan niyang muli si Lex.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Do you think Freaky Hanna came?" he asked feeling a bit anxious. Lex stared at him like he was an apparition.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Are you freaking serious?" hindi makapaniwalang tanong nito. "Pumunta ka talaga dito para mag-sorry kay Hanna? Pano kung i-sumo wrestling ka noon?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"O kaya man itali sa puno at ipakagat ang toytoy mo sa langgam?" sabay na napalingon sila ni Lex sa pinanggalingan ng tinig. Nakatawang tumabi sa kanila si Caleb.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hardcore shit, Bok!" nag-high five ang mga ito, habang siya ay hindi pa rin mapakali. Patuloy na nanghahaba ang kanyang leeg kakahanap ng pamliyar na mukhang kanina pa nikya hinihintay.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Seryoso talaga siya. Hihingi siya ng tawad kay Freaky Hanna. Kailangan. Kinakabahan siya sa tuwing maiisip niyang maaaring tama si Jenny. Ang kamalasan niya sa buhay pamilya, buhay pag-ibig at kung anu-ano pa ay
                                            baka dahil sa koneksyon niya sa babaeng iyon. Hangga't hindi pa siya napapatawad nito - hindi mawawala ang kamalasang iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Bad luck, ika nga ng iba.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Lingon ka ng lingon diyan, bakit hindi mo subukang magtanong sa usherette doon sa labas?" agad na sinunod niya ang sinabi ni Caleb. Lumabas siya at tinungo ang usherette na kanina pa nandoon pero hindi niya pinapansin.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Good evening." Nginitian niya ito. Tumayo ang usherette at sinalubong siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You're Kerky," kinikilig na sabi nito. He smiled at her. It was obvious, the woman likes him.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Yeah... so..." pinagapang niya ang kanyang mga daliri sa mesa patungo sa mga daliri nito. Their hands touched and the girl - which he doesn't know - almost had an orgasmic expression on her face. "Can I ask a favor?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Oh yeah..." the woman was almost panting for air.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Did you see or hear a certain Hanna Mendoza come in?" bigla ay nag-iba ang ekspresyon ng mukha ng babaeng katabi niya. Parang hindi ito makapaniwala na iyon ang tanong na lumabas mula sa bibig niya. Agad na kinuha
                                            nito ang log book na nakapatong sa mesa at atubiling binuksan.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Yep, she came in earlier at 6:45." Walang kalatoy-latoy na sabi nito. He smiled at her.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Thanks." Naglakad siya palayo at pinuntahan ang kanyang mga kaibigan.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Nandito daw." Hindi niya alam kung anong mararamdaman niya. Freaky Hanna came. She was here. Anong gagawin niya ngayon?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Oh, akala ko ba magso-sorry ka? Are you okay? You look flushed." Nang-aasar na wika ni Lex. Tinalikuran niya ang mga ito at muling pumasok sa loob. Patuloy ang paglinga niya at pagsilip sa bawat mukha na naroon.
                                            Makakampante lamang siya sa oras na makita niya si Freaky Hanna.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ano bang hinahanap natin?" tanong ni Caleb.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Si Freaky Hanna. Sino pa ba?" inis na sagot niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"No, I mean how do we know if it's her."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Huminto siya at humarap kay Caleb.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Siyempre, mataba iyon. Nakasalamin saka mukhang freak!" he hissed at him.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"So kung mukhang freak si Hanna na agad?" tumatangong wika ni Caleb. "Alright, maghanap na tayo ng freak."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Oo! Anong aasahan natin doon? It's not like she'll be pretty now. Imposible iyon." Kumento pa niya habang naglalakad sa gitna ng hall. Pahakbang na muli siya nang bigla ay may mabangga siyang babae.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"My gosh." Napasinghap ang babae. Napahinto naman siya. Agad niyang sinino ang kanyang nabangga.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Miss, I'm very sorry." Magalang na sabi niya. He looked at the woman standing in front of him only to be amazed by the view. The woman in front was wearing a simple black dress, but her beauty was radiating. Nakakasilaw
                                            ang kagandahan ng babaeng nasa kanyang harapan. She has what they call a timeless beauty. She had a heart shaped face, an aristocratic eyebrows, upturned nose and luscious, sensual, full, red lips.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She was the most beautiful woman she had ever laid eyes on.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"It's okay." She smiled at him. Hindi rin niya mapigilang ang mapangiti.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hi, I'm ---" hindi na niya naituloy ang sasabihin dahil biglang nagsalita ang babae sa kanyang harapan.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Antonio Harvey Kerkmez." Nakangiting wika nito. Nakadama siya ng kasiyahan dahil kilala siya nito. Pero hindi niya alam kung bakit parang may kakaiba sa tono ng babae habang sinasambit ang kanyang pangalan. Parang
                                            may lamang galit ang tinig nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"How'd you know?" hindi mapigilang tanong niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Oh, we were batch mates and I know you're in a band." Nakangiti pa ring sagot nito. Magsasalita pa sana siya nang bigla niyang marinig si Caleb.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Pre! Ayon. Si Freaky Hanna na yata iyon!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Sinundan niya ang direksyong tinuturo ni Caleb. Napaawang ang labi niya nang makita ang isang babaeng may kalakihan ang katawan at nakakulay pulang lacey dress. Napangiwi siya. Hanggang ngayon walang pinagbago si
                                            Freaky Hanna. Mukha pa rin siyang freak. Ipinilig niya ang kanyang ulo. Hihingi siya ng sorry at hindi mang-iinsulto. Dapat ay magagandang salita lang ang lalabas sa bibig niya. Panandaliang nakalimutan niya
                                            ang magandang babae sa kanyang harapan.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Inilang hakbang niya ang kinatatayuan ni Freaky Hanna. Ayaw niyang mag-isip, pero nakakadama siya ng kaba. Sa laki ng braso ni Freaky Hanna kung babrasuhan siya nito matapos ang paghingi niya ng tawad ay malamang
                                            na tatalsik siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"E-excuse m-me... Freak-este Hanna." Ang lakas ng kabog ng dibdib niya. Lumingon ang babae. Tumaas ang kilay nito at saka tiningnan siya mula ulo hanggang paa.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi ko alam kung natatandaan mo pa ako." Napakamot siya ng ulo. "Pero ako si Kerky at may ginawa akong malaking kasalanan sa iyo noong high school. Gusto ko sanang mag-sorry. I want you to know that I didn't
                                            intend to hurt you. I was young and immature and I should've ----"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi ako si Freaky Hanna." Natigilan siya ng maintindihan niya ang sinasabi ng babaeng nsa harapan niya. "It's me, Kerky. Sandy. You're ex-girlfriend."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kulang sabihin na napanganga siya sa nakikita. Si Sandy na noon ay hugis coca-cola ay naging hugis LPG na ngayon!</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kung siya si Sandy nasaan si Hanna?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Nasaan si Freaky Hanna?!" frustrated na tanong niya habang nakatingin kay Sandy. Napalakas ang boses niya kung kaya't napatingin sa direksyon nila ang ibang tao. Tumahimik ang paligid. Comical ang expression ng
                                            mga miron habang nakatingin sa kanila. But then, out of nowhere, someone spoke...</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I believe that it is me, you are looking for, Mr. Kerkmez. I am Hanna. Freaky Hanna."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Nanigas ang likod niya. Heto na iyon. Makakaharap na niya si Freaky Hanna. Dahan-dahan niyang nilingon ang nagmamay-ari ng tinig. And for the second time that night, he was taken aback.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You're Freaky Hanna!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hindi mapigilang ni Hanna ang pagtaas ng kilay niya. Bagaman nakakaramdam siyan ng iritasyon ay pinilit pa rin niyang mapangiti. Kanina ay gusto niya tumawa ng malakas habang pinanonood niya si Kerky na humihingi
                                            ng tawad sa babaeng inakala nitong siya. Gusto sana niyang lapitan si Sandy at ipamukha kung sino na ang mukhang freak ngayon at kung sino na ang dapat maging laughing stock. But she would never stoop down her
                                            level so she just stood there and watch the two of them as they talk.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I am. Hello." Pinilit niyang pakalmahin ang kanyang sarili. She tried to act as friendly as she could pero deep inside her, she wanted to slap Kerky. Taon na ang lumipas ngunit hanggang ngayon ay wala itong pinagbago.
                                            Judgmental pa rin ito, bully at masama ang ugali. Narinig niya ang sinabi nito tungkol sa kanya kanina.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Mataba, nakasalamin, mukhang freak!</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Napangisi siya. Kung titingnan sila ni Sandy ngayon, sino ang mukhang freak?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"May I have your attention please?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Natigil lang ang komosyong iyon nang magsalita ang master of ceremony. Parang mga langgam na nagsibalik ang mga tao sa kanya-kanyang mga buhay na para bang walang pakialam sa nangyari kanina. She glared at Kerky
                                            and gave him her sweetest and friendliest smile kahit na sa oras na iyon ay gustong-gusto niya itong saktan. Bumalik siya sa table niya at matamang nakinig sa nagsasalita. Ayon dito, nakaipon ang batch nila
                                            ng sapat na funds para sa charity event na gagapin next week.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She wanted to stay and watch what will happen next to Kerky ngayon na nagkita na sila. Hindi niya alam kung bakit siya nito hinahanap o kung anong sinabi ni kay Sandy kaninang nag-uusap sila. Wala siyang panahon
                                            para mag-stay ngayong gabi. She had an early flight tomorrow morning. Pupunta siya sa Mindanao for another assignment about the war. Huminga siya nang malalim. She was excited for her assignment pero mas nae-excite
                                            siya dahil sa nakita niyang reaction ni Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Maya-maya ay tumayo na siya. She quietly walked towards the exit door. Ngiuningitian niya ang lahat ng nakakasalubong niya. Papunta na siya sa may parking lot when she heard someone call out her name.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"H-hanna!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She stopped dead. Nilingon niya ang nagmamay-ari ng tinig. She smiled widely when she saw that it was Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hi." Confident na bati niya rito. Napangiwi ito at saka napakamot ng ulo.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"May kailangan ka?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"A-ano k-kasi..." huminga ito ng malalim. Tumaas ang kilay niya. I don't know where to start." Mahinang sabi nito. Lalong lumawak ang pagkakangiti niya. She knew it. She had Kerkry just where she wanted to put him.
                                            Lumapit siya rito at saka ipinalupot ang kanyang kamay sa braso nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Why don't you walk with me to my car and start from the beginning?" malamyos na wika niya. She was aware of Kerky's reaction. Tatlong beses itong napalunok bago sila nagsimulang manglakad. Gusto niyang tumawa ng
                                            malakas.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"What is it, my dear?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ano k-kasi..." napapailing siya. Totoo ba itong naririnig niya? The great Antonio Kerkmez was stuttering in front of her - Freaky Hanna. Kumawala ito mula sa pagkakahawak niya. He took a step in front of him and
                                            looked at her - eye to eye.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Here goes nothing." Kinakabahang pahayag nito. "I know you hate me..."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She wanted to smirk. Pinigilan niya lamang ang kanyang sarili. Hate? That was the understatement of the decade. She doesn't hate Kerky. She loathes him. She disgust him. She wanted to kill him for making her feel
                                            so small, and for hating herself.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"But I'm taking this shot." He continued. "I'm sorry, Hanna. I was young back then. I didn't know what I was doing. I should've never pulled that trick on you ten years ago sa prom night. Dapat hindi ko sinabing
                                            ---"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Mahal mo ako?" lihim na naikuyom niya ang kanyang palad. The nerve of this man to bring back those old wounds! She wanted to hurt him - tear his soul apart and give it to the demons for them to eat! Ganyan kalaki
                                            ang galit niya kay Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Y-yeah..." nag-iwas ito ng tingin. Bigla ay tumawa siya. Hindi niya alam kung para saan ang halakhak na iyon. All she knew was that she needed to do that. Maybe to mask the pain and the anger she could feel inside
                                            her.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"W-why are you laughing?" parang natatakot na tanong nito sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I'm sorry." Tumikhim siya. "It's just that you're such a child."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Huh?" nagtatakang tanong ni Kerky sa kanya. She waved her hands.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I was never mad at you. We'll - at first I was because you made me feel stupid pero I grew up, I matured and I moved on."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"So hindi ka galit sa akin?" nasisiyahang wika nito sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi." She smiled.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"So we can be friends."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hindi niya napigilan ang pagtaas ng kanyang kilay nang ialok ni Kerky ang kamay nito sa kanya. She wanted to break his arm and make his insides bleed. She wanted him to scream of pain.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Friends." Tinanggap niya ang kamay nito ng buong ngiti. "There's nothing wrong with being friends." May diin ang bawat katagang sinasabi niya. Malapad ang ngiting ibinigay nito sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Maybe then we could have coffee tomorrow?" he said again. She gritted her teeth. This man was pushing her patience through the limit.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"That would be nice pero wala ako bukas. I'd be flying to Mindanao. But I'll be back in a week. Maybe then we could have coffee. Your treat."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Halata sa mukha nito ang disappointment. Huminga siya ng malalim. Ganito ba ang epekto niya kay Antonio Kerkmez?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I have to go now. I'll see you in a week." Nginitian niya ito saka nilagpasan. Ubod ng tamis ang mga ngiting sumilay sa kanyang mga labi. Naisip niyang ayos na rin kung magiging magkaibigan sila. Sabi nga keep
                                            your friends close and your enemies closer. And in this scenario, Kerky was the enemy - and she needed to keep him close.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Sumakay siya sa kanyang kotse. Tinted ang salamin ng kayang sasakyan kung kaya't hindi nakikita ni Kerky ang matatalim na tinging ibinibigay niya rito. She ignited the car, bago siya tuluyang umalis ay ibinaba niya
                                            ang bintana.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hey," sa pagkakataong iyon ay nakatalikod na si Kerky at pabalik sa loob ng hall. Niligon siya nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Changed your mind?" nakangisi ito sa kanya. Iniabot niya rito ang kanyang calling card.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Nah... I just want to give you my number." Mukhang nagtataka ito. "Ano ka ba? How can you call me after a week kung hindi mo alam ang number ko?" she winked at him.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I'll see you around, Kerky. Bye!" she waved at him. Pinasibad niya ang kotse. Habang papalayo ay sinisilip niya si Antonio Kekrmez sa kanyang rearview mirror. She grinned. The game of revenge had just started and
                                            she would make sure that this time, she would be the one with the last laugh...</p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hanna Mendoza</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">09478804343</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">MBC TV STATION</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Sa loob ng anim na araw ay hindi na mabilang ni Kerky kung ilang beses na niyang tinitigan ang itim na calling card na ibinigay ni Hanna sa kanya noong gabing magkita sila sa reunion. Hindi siya makapaniwala. Totoo
                                            pala na maaaring mabago ng lumipas na panahon ang isang tao. Sinong mag-aakala na si Sandy - his ex - girlfriend would look like that now? And Freaky Hanna would be - anong adjective ba ang pwede niyang gamitin?
                                            Beautiful would be an understatement - Magnificent. That was the word he was looking for. He couldn't believe that Hanna would be that magnificent. Isa pang bagay na napakahirap paniwalaan ay ang nararamdaman
                                            niya ngayon. He was - in a twisted way - attracted to Hanna.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Pwede ba iyon, bok?" ibinaba niya ang calling card at saka tumingin kay Lex. Sabado noon at nakatambay lamang siya sa unit nito. Wala silang band related work noong araw na iyon although may pasok si Calen at si
                                            Caleb. Kung tutuusin, lahat sila ay may ibang trabaho. Hindi sila iyong banda na banda lang talaga. They are professionals. Calen works as a toy designer in an international company habang si Caleb naman ay
                                            isang renowned photographer sa isang top selling magazine. Lex was a licensed psychologist pero hindi naman na nito napa-practice ang pagiging psychologist. Habang siya - isa siyang architect at tulad ni Lex
                                            ay hindi naman niya nagagamit ang kanyang propesyon at dahil iyon sa relasyon nilang mag-ina.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ang alin?" tanong nito habang nakatingin sa gitarang nasa mga kamay nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ma-attract sa isang babaeng na-bully mo noon." Lex slowly looked at him. He crossed his legs, and arms and rested his back on the couch. Tinitigan siya nito na para bang isa siyang palaka na malapit ng i-dissect.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Are you attracted to Hanna?" he asked in a very unusual tone.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I don't know. But I wanted to see her again."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"So... you want to." Huminga ito ng malalim. "Can you elaborate to me the things that you felt when you saw her that night?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Shit, bok!" binato niya si Lex ng unan. "Huwag mo ngang gawin sa akin iyang pagiging psychologist mo! Tang ina, bok! Psycho ka lang!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Tang ina ka rin! Nagtatanong lang eh!" ibinalik niya sa akin ang unan na ibinato ko sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Nagtatanong lang ako kung posible ito. Kasi naman iyong puso ko..."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"It's not the heart that is responsible for that emotion, Kerky. Ang trabaho lang ng puso ay ang mag-pump ng blood. It's the hypothalamus that gives you that feeling. Love is just hormones, bok."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi ko naman sinabi na mahal ko siya. I'm just attracted to her." Napatanong si Lex. Sino ba naman ang hindi maa-attract kay Hanna. She's very beautiful. She's perfect. Kung itatabi nga siya sa rito, magmumukha
                                            siyang alalay.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kung attracted ka sa kanya, anong gagawin mo?" muling tanong nito sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Itatanong ko kay Keith," biglang sabi niya. Kumunot ang noo ni Lex habang nakatingin sa kanya. He grinned at him. "Not the actual Keith. Just my Iphone app." Inilabas niya ang kanyang cellphone at saka ipinakita
                                            ang sinasabi kay Lex.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Tatawagan ko ba si Hanna?" he shook his phone and it made a noise afterwards.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Paki ko? Tae ka!" he burst out of laughter. Natawa siya sa hitsura ni Lex. Napailing ito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Saan mo ba napagkukuha iyan app na iyan?" inis na tanong nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Calen designed this. He used some effects from his mac and the itanong mo kay Keith app was born. Gusto mo ipasa ko sa'yo?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Sa inyo na lang." Lex made a face. "Anong gagawin mo kay Hanna?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Tatawagan ko siya. Bukas na ang balik niya." Lumawak ang kanyang ngiti. "Tapos magkakape kami."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kape lang? Walang rendezvous?" nginisihan siya ng kaibigan. Alam na alam na niya kung anong tumatakbo sa isip nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Huwag mo akong itulad sa'yo, Alissandro." Binato niya ito ng unan. Huminga siya ng malalim at saka muling tiningnan ang calling card ni Hanna. Muli niyang kinuha ang kanyang cellphone at saka tumipa roon. He would
                                            send her a text message that would start their converstation pagkatapos noon ay bahala na. Sana lang talaga ay hindi pa siya nakakalimutan nito. Dahil siya, sa loob ng anim na araw mula nang makita niya itong
                                            muli ay hindi na nawala sa isipan niya si Hanna at ang magandang ngiti nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hey, Hanna! It's Kerky. I hope you remember the coffee date you promised me. See you tomorrow!"</p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Tumaas ang kilay ni Hanna habang binabasa ang text message na galing kay Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Pasimpleng kinagat niya ang kanyang labi - mannerism niya iyon sa tuwing makakaramdam siya ng kakaibang excitement. Excited siya dahil unti-unti ng nahuhulog si Kerky sa kanyang mga plano.
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"What are you excited about?" iyon ang agad na bungad sa kanya ng kanyang Ate Adriana. She was at their parents' house that day. Napaaga ang balik niya galing Mindanao dahil ipinatawag siya ng big boss ng t.v. station.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Revenge is sweet, Ate." Ngiting-ngiting sabi niya. Tinitigan siya ng kanyang kapatid.</p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Sigurado ka ba diyan, Ayella Hanna?" tanong nito sa kanya. Alam nito kung ano ang sinasabi niya sapagkat nai-kwento niya iyon dito noong gabing bago siya umalis papuntang Mindanao.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"It's time that I give him what he deserves." Seryosong sabi niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Sis, may karma naman." Inirapan niya ang kanyang ate. Ang lagay ba ay hihintayin niya pa ang karma? Paano kung ma-miss ng karma si Kerky? Or worse, baka manghina ang karma sa charms ng unggoy na iyon - dahil aminin
                                            man niya o hindi, malakas ang charms ng Kerky na iyon. He had this thing na kapag tiningnan mo siya ay parang gagawin mo ang lahat ng ipagagawa niya sa iyo without questions asked.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Karma is a bitch. But I'm bitchier!" she growled. Napailing ang ate niya. Alam naman nitong hindi na magbabago ang kanyang gusto. At alam rin nitong kapag si Kerky na ang pinag-uusapan ay nag-iiba ang ihip ng hangin
                                            sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Anong klaseng paghihiganti ba ang gagawin mo? Are you going to feed him to the dogs?" biro pa nito. Napahalukipkip siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"What is the best way of getting back to a jerk who made you look like a fool in front of many people at the night of your senior prom ten years ago?" she smiled sweetly at her sister. "I'll make him fall in love
                                            with me, Ate. At kapag hulog na hulog na siya, saka ko siya bibitiwan at hahayaang malaglag sa bangin ng kahihiyan."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Her plan was perfect. Iyon na iyon mismo ang gagawin niya kay Antonio Kerkmez. Hindi na niya hahayang saktan at paiyakin mula siya nito dahil sa pagkakataong iyon, sisiguraduhin niya na ito naman ang ikiyak at masasaktan
                                            dahil sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bahala ka, Hanna. But I'm warning you. Do not fall in love or else your plan will backfire."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She looked at her sister with disbelief in her eyes.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Fall in love? Huh! Ewww!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"So what have you been up too?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Tanong niya kay Kerky. Nasa loob sila ng isang coffee shop nang araw na iyon. Hindi siya makapaniwala. Sa nakikita kasi niyang hitsura ni Kerky ay parang tuwang-tuwa itong pumayag siyang lumabas na kasama ito. She
                                            bit her lower lip. Her plan was working.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Uhmm..." tumikhim ito. "Nothing much. Just the usual."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Usual? You mean making someone cry by humiliating them in front of other people?" sarkastikong sabi niya. Mukhang napipilan naman ito. Hindi kaagad nakahuma si Kerky habang titig na titig sa kanya. Tumawa siya
                                            ng malakas.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I was just kidding! You should've seen your face!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Namutla talaga ito at parang hindi alam ang gagawin. Kulang na lang ay pagpawisan ito ng malamig. Maya-maya pa ay sinasabayan na siya nito sa pagtawa. Alam na alam niya ang tunog ng kanyang halakhak. It was fake.
                                            But she guessed that Kerky was too stupid to even notice. He was even laughing with her. Natigil lang ang pagtawa nila nang dumating ang in-order nila. Kerky ordered a piece of vanilla cheese cake and mocha
                                            frappe with extra sugar habang siya ay simpleng kape lang ang in-order.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Are you sure na ayaw mo ng cake?" tanong nito sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Nope. I'm watching my sugar and carbs..."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Nagda-diet ka pa eh ang payat-payat mo." Sabi nito habang ngumunguya ng cheese cake. Napaawang ang labi niya. Iniinsulto ba siya nito? Siya payat? Alam niyang medyo mababa ang timbang niya kaysa noon, pero walang
                                            tao ang nagsabi sa kanya na siya ay payat!</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I'm not thin." Giit niya. Umiling si Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Mas payat ka ngayon kaysa noong huli tayong nagkita eight days ago."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Lalong umawang ang kanyang bibig. How could this man say that! Noon iniinsulto siya nito dahil overweight siya. Ngayon naman ang tingin nito sa kanya ay underweight. Saan ba siya lulugar?
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Anyway, anong ginawa mo sa Mindanao?" tanong nito. Nagkibit-balikat siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I took some pictures, wrote about the rebellion and some other stuff about the dispute between the army, rebels and some civilians." She sipped her coffee.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hardcore pala iyang trabaho mo. Hindi ka natatakot? Baka mamaya ma-kidnap ka noong mga rebelde." Sagot nito sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Why would I be scared?" ngumiti siya. "I like the fact that I'm being excited about something unusual. I like taking risks." Sabi pa niya. Tumaas ang kilay niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"How about you? What's so good about your band?" sarcastic ang pagtatanong niya. Gusto niyang ipamukha kay Kerky na mas may kwenta ang trtabaho niya kaysa sa trabaho nito. Ano lang ba ang ginagawa nito sa buhay?
                                            Nagbabanda. That's not even a real job - habang siya she was - in some sort of way - helping change people's lives.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Our music and the satisfaction we feel whenever we're on stage." Ngiting-ngiting sagot nito. She smirked. Rehearsed ang sagot ni Kerky. Malamang ay iyon ay palaging sinasabi nito sa mga press sa tuwing ini-interview
                                            ang banda nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I see." Napailing siya. Kerky was definitely a bum. Anong magandang dulot ng banda nito? Wala. They were just a bunch of people trying to break in the industry at sigurado siyang mawawala ito kaagad tulad ng ibang
                                            mga banda. Hindi sila magtatagal. Humalukipkip siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"May girlfriend ka na?" tanong niya. Tumingin ito sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Wala pa eh." Sagot nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bakit naman?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ngayon ka lang kasi nagpakita ulit." Ngumiti ito sa kanya. Nanlaki naman ang kanyang mga mata. Bigla ay pumalya ang tibok ng puso niya. Ano bang nangyayari? Pumalya ang tibok ng puso? What the hell? Ipinilig niya
                                            ang kanyang ulo at saka muling tinitigan si Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Mais..." nakangising sabi niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ako na ang basag." Sagot naman ni Kerky sa kanya. She made a face.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi ako bilib sa banda mo." Diretsong sabi niya rito. Natigilan si Kerky at napatingin sa kanya. Hindi niya mapigilang ang pagtaas ng kilay at ang pagguhit ng isang nakakalokong ngiti sa kanyang labi. It was
                                            true. Hindi siya bilib sa The Pastels. She saw their set noong nag-reunion sila, they were good but not good enough to be the next big thing.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ah," ani Kerky habang ibinaba nito ang hawak nitong tinidor. Bigla ay nagtaka siya. Pinintasan niya ang banda nito - ang trabaho nito - pero iyon lang ang sinabi nito sa kanya.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"What you're not mad at me?" iritableng tanong niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi." Ngumiti ito. "Iba't-iba ang opinyon ng tao. Kung ikaw hindi ka bilib sa banda ko, may mga tao na bilib sa amin. Kaya igagalang ko ang opinyon mo."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Lihim na naikuyom niya ang kanyang palad. Hindi siya makapaniwala na napahiya siya rito. Of all people dapat alam niya ang bagay na iyon. She was a journalist after all! Alam niya dapat ang principle ng fact and
                                            opinion.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Dapat mainis ka sa akin dahil hindi ako bilib sa banda mo." Ipinagpatuloy pa rin niya ang pang-aasar dito kahit na sa unang round palang ay duguan na siya. Makakabawi rin naman siya at sisiguraduhin niya iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ayoko. Friends tayo kaya hindi ako maiinis sa'yo. I mean two friends can exist kahit na magkaiba ang kanilang mga beliefs. Isa pa, I'm going to make sure na bibilib ka sa banda ko at siyempre - sa akin." Muli siyang
                                            binigyan ng isang matamis na ngiti ni Kerky. Kasabay ng ngiting iyon ay kinindatan rin siya nito. Nagpapa-charming ang unggoy na lalaking ito sa kanya at ang hindi niya maintindihan ay kung bakit parang tinatablan
                                            siya. Hindi niya maintindihan kung para saan ang abnormality ng heart beat niya ngayon. Nakindatan lang siya biglang nag-somersault ang puso niya? Hindi pwede iyon! Mas nanaiisin niya pang dahil sa kape ang
                                            pagbilis ng tibok ng puso niya at hindi dahil sa lalaking kinamumuhian niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Whatever. I really don't like your band." Inis na inis na sabi niya. Gusto niyang sabunutan ang sarili dahil siya naman ang nagsimula ng asaran contest na ito pero sa ngayon siya ang naaasar, siya ang natatalo.
                                            Hindi naman siya pikon pero napipikon siya kay Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Saan mo gustong magpunta after nito?" nakatawang tinanong siya nito. She looked at him habang nag-iisip siya. Saan nga ba magandang ayain ang ungas na ito? Sa Luneta park at ipabaril sa mga gwardya ni Rizal? Sa
                                            Manila Zoo at ipalapa sa mga lion, crocodile at malaking sawa o sa Star City tapos sasakay sila ng Ferris wheel at itutulak niya ito?
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Excuse me..." bago pa niya nasagot ang tanong ni Kerky ay may isang babaeng lumapit sa table nila. May dala itong camera, lapis at papel. Ngiting-ngiti ito habang tinititigan si Kerky. "Ikaw si Kerky ng The Pastels
                                            diba?" parang kilig na kilig na tanong ng babae kay Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Yeah..." sumagot ang unggoy.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Oh my gosh! I'm a fan! Can I take a picture with you?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Tinanguan ni Kerky ang babae. Walang sabi-sabi na binalingan siya nito at ibinigay ang camera na dala nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Gandahan mo, te. Pang-profile pic ko ito sa fb!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Lumapit ang hitad na babae kay Kerky habang ang unggoy naman ay umakbay sa babaeng hitad. Lalong nag-init ang ulo niya. Parang gusto niyang sabunutan ang babaeng iyon at kaladkarin palayo kay Kerky. Kinuhanan niya
                                            ang mga ito ng litrato. Pagkatapos ay naiinis na ibinalik niya ang camera sa babaeng iyon. Ang buong akala niya ay aalis na ito ngunit hindi. She stayed at pilit pa ring nakikipagkwentuhan kay Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Uhm, excuse me, if you don't mind can we have our privacy back?" sarcastic na sabi niya sa babae. Binalingan naman siya nito at tinaasan ng kilay.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"At sino ka naman?". How dare this woman ask her who she was!</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ako ang date ni Antonio Kerkmez ngayon. So if you don't mind, you can leave now or I'm going to call the guards." Nakipagsukatan ng tingin sa kanya ang babae. Sa huli ito rin ang nagmartsa paalis.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Grabe ka naman." Tila hindi makapaniwalang sabi ni Kerky habang nakatingin sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ano?" inis na tanong niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi mo pa ako boyfriend, nang-aaway ka na ng groupie. Paano kapag naging tayo na, mananabunot ka na, ganoon?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"At sinong may sabing magiging boyfriend kita?" wala sa loob na napapitik siya sa hangin.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ako. Liligawan kaya kita." Cool na cool na sabi nito. Her left brow rose. Kung makapagsalita ang lalaking ito ay parang siguradong-sigurado siya sa kanyang sarili.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ganoon? Paano kung hindi kita sagutin?" she played along, after all, this was a part of her plan.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Sasagutin mo ako. After two months, girlfriend na kita."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Two months?" hindi niya alam kung maiinsulto siya o matatawa. Dalawang buwan? Tinaningan talaga nito ang panliligaw nito sa kanya? "You think I'm that easy?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi ganoon iyon, Hanna." Kerky sighed. "What I mean is, it will only take you two months - more or less - before you find yourself falling deeply in love with me; so in love that you would want to grow old me
                                            with me as much as I would want to spend forever with you."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Bahagyang napaawang ang kanyang mga labi. She didn't know what to say or how she would react. Ano bang dapat niyang sabihin. She knew that she had to think of a smart comeback para naman hindi siya magmukhang timang.
                                            Pero paano niya gagawin iyon kung hindi niya makontrol ang mabilis na pagtibok ng puso niya? Hindi naman siya denial at inaamin niya na nakaramdam siya ng kakaibang sensasyon dahil sa mga salitang binitiwan
                                            ni Kerky sa kanya. She felt a tingling sensation run down her spine at kahit nakaupo siya ay nadarama niya ang panginginig ng tuhod niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Y-you would want to spend forever w-with m-me?" nais niyang saktan ang kanyang sarili dahil sa dami ng mga salitang pwedeng niyang sabihin ay iyon pa ang lumabas sa kanyang bibig. Lalong naging abnormal ang pakiramdam
                                            niya nang biglang siyanvg nginitian ni Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"That's for me to know and you to find out." He was smiling from ear to ear as he said those words. She made a face. Natawa lamang ito. He was playing with her. Alam na alam niya iyon at naiinis siya dahil sa round
                                            one ng larong sinimulan niya ay siya ang natatalo.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ewan ko sa'yo!" inis na wika niya. Pinagtuunan niya ng pansin ang kapeng kanina pa naghahanap ng atensyon. Kasalukuyan niyang iniinom iyon nang muling magsalita si Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I like you, Hanna. Seryoso ako kanina noong sabihin kong liligawan kita.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">=================</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kerky was smiling so wide as he walked with Hanna inside that mall. Katatapos lang nilang magkape at naisip niyang dalhin si Hanna sa mall na iyon. Malapit lang kasi iyon sa coffee shop na pinagkapehan niyang dalawa.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bakit nakatawa ka?" nakalabing tanong nito sa kanya. Umiling siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Wala lang. Ang ganda mo kasi." Lalong lumawak ang pagkakangiti niya nang makita niyang namula ang pisngi nito. Agad na nag-iwas ng tingin si Hanna sa kanya at nagpatuloy sa paglakad. Huminga siya ng malalim. He
                                            was having the time of his life. Natutuwa siyang kasama niya ito ngayon. Hindi talaga niya inaasahan na ito na talaga iyong Hanna na nakilala niya noong high school pa lang siya. He was happy to see her. He
                                            was happy to spend time with her. He was happy because he likes her.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Attracted siya kay Hanna - hindi dahil sa ganda nito - ngunit dahil sa isang bagay na hindi niya alam at hindi niya matukoy. There was something about Hanna na sa tuwing naiisip niya ay napapangiti na lamang siya
                                            basta. Alam niyang masyadong mabilis kung iisipin. Nito lang sila nagkita. Pangalawang beses niya pa lang itong nakausap. Unang pagkakataon pa lang na lumabas sila - pero sa pakiramdam niya ay parang napakatagal
                                            na ng panahon na sila ay magkasama. Wala pa naman siya sa punto na mahal na niya ito ngunit alam niyang hindi imposible iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bakit nagba-blush ka?" tudyo niya rito. Hinarap siya ni Hanna.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi noh. Rosy cheeks talaga ako." Lumabi pa ito. Ipinilig niya ang kanyang ulo. Kanina pa ang labing iyon - kanina pa niya naiisip kung anong pakiramdam ng mga labi ni Hanna sa mga labi niya. He wanted to know
                                            if her lips would taste sweet under his kisses. He wanted to know... pero alam niyang hindi pa maaari.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hey you wanna go ice skating?" tanong niya rito habang naglalakad. Huminto ito at tumingin sa kanya. Nanlalaki pa ang mga mata nito. "Huwag mong sabihing hindi ka marunong?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I just d-don't feel like it." Nabubulol na sabi nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi ka marunong?" he teased her. "Ang tapang mong magpunta sa Mindanao tapos hindi ka marunong mag-ice skate?!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Walang snow sa Pilipinas kaya hindi ako required matuto ng ice skating!" angil nito sa kanya. Napapailing na hinawakan niya ang kamay nito. Saglit namang nanigas si Hanna at parang napapasong binawi nito ang kamay.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"What?" he asked. Again, he reached for her hand and this time he made sure that she won't be able to let go. Masarap sa pakiramdam ang kamay ni Hanna. Napakalambot ng palad nito. Tumingin siya rito. He wanted to
                                            pull her closer and stare at her. Kaya lang ay baka isipin nitong natatanga na siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ayokong mag-skate!" singhal nito. Umiling siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Sa ayaw at sa gusto mo ay mag-skate tayo. Para rin sa'yo ito. Paano kung mapunta ka sa Alaska tapos iyong gyera nasa yelo, paano ka susugod?" hinatak niya si Hanna papalapit sa skating rink. Hindi pa rin niya binibitiwan
                                            ang kamay nito. Kinausap niya ang isang babaeng nakatyo malapit sa skating rink, he paid for their ticket and for their shoes. Maya-maya pa ay iniaabot na ng babae ang ice skating shoes na gagamitin nilang dalawa.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ayoko, Kerky." Muling sabi ni Hanna. Nginitian niya lamang ito at saka pinaupo.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Akina iyong shoes mo." Malumanay na sabi niya habang hinuhubad ang suot nitong sapatos. Matapos iyon ay siya na mismo ang nagsuot ng skate shoes kay Hanna. Habang ginagawa niya iyon ay titig na titig siya sa mukha
                                            nito.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ang cute mo talaga kapag nagba-blush ka." Matapos niyang isuot ang skate shoes kay Hanna ay inalalayan niya itong tumayo. Dahil hindi marunong ay ilang beses itong nadudulas kaya naisip niya hawakan si Hanna sa
                                            bewang.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kerky..." Tawag nito sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Gentleman ako." Biro niya rito. Hinapit niya ang bewang nito at iginiya sa gitna ng skating rink. He was so close to her that he could smell her baby like scent. He closed his eyes to savor that moment. Siya at
                                            si Hanna - malapit sa isa't - isa. It was a moment to remember.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ay kabayo!" napasigaw ito nang bigla silang mapaupo. Napatingin sa kanila ang ilan habang si Hanna naman ay tawa ng tawa. "Ikaw kasi! Nabagsak tuloy tayo!" tatawa-tawang sabi nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"S-sorry. Nasaktan ka ba?" tanong niya. Tumatawa pa rin si Hanna at hindi naman niya maiwasang na titigan ito. Tulad noong nangyari noong gabi ng reunion, muli na naman niyang naisip na si Hanna ang pinakamagandang
                                            babaeng kanyang nakita sa buong buhay niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bakit nakatingin ka na naman?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ikaw na yata talaga ang auntie ko."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Nagsalubong ang kilay ni Hanna sa pagtataka. He smiled at her. Hinawakan niya ang kanang kamay nito at itinapat sa dibdib niya kung nasaan ang kanyang puso.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Auntie-nitibok ng puso ko..." kitang-kita niya ang muling pamumula ng pisngi nito. He felt the urge of touching her face and he did just that. He wanted to freeze this moment for he knew that even if he doesn't
                                            have any memory at all - his heart and his soul would always remember this day - the day when he first went out with Hanna - the woman that could make him feel this good about himself.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Why are you biting your lip?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hindi maalis-alis ni Hanna ang mga mata niya sa laptop na kaharap. Ayaw niyang harapin ang nang-uuyam na mga mata ni Menchie. Menchie knew her so well na isang kibo't pa ;ang ng labi niya ay alam na nito ang mga
                                            bagay na iniisip niya. She knew that if she look at Menchie now, mahuhuoi nito na apektado siya sa ungas na Kerky na iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hindi nga niya maintidihan ang kanyang sarili. Hindi siya dapat naaapektuhan sa mokong na iyon, pero isang kindat at ngiti lang nito sa kanya kahapon ay nagsirko na ang puso niya - at hindi niya matanggap ang bagay
                                            na iyon. Galit siya kay Kerky. Kinamumuhian niya ito ng higit pa sa lahat ng masamang element at masamang espirito sa buyong mundo pero bakit ganoon ang nararamdaman niya para dito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Go away. I'm working." She hissed at Menchie. Hindi niya pa rin inaangat ang kanyang ulo. She just continued pretending to look at those nasty pictures she took in Mindanao. Nang masiguro niyang wala na si Menchie
                                            sa tapat ng kanyang cubicle ay saka lamang siya nag-angat ng ulo. Napalabi siya. Ano bang dapat niyang gawin? Does she need a new plan? Gustong-gusto na talaga niyang makaganti sa unggoy na iyon pero paano naman
                                            niya gagawin iyon kung apektado siya ng nakakainis na charms nito?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kainis!" padabog na ibinaba niya ang ballpen na hawak at padaskol na tumayo siya mula sa kanyang kinauupuan. She needed a break. Kailangan malinawan ng utak niya. She needed focus. Kailangan maibalik sa tamang
                                            direksyon ang utak niya. She needed to get back at her game. She wanted revenge and that's what Kerky will get. Tinungo niya ang garden ng TV Station. She sat at the bench and inhaled sharply.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Dapat hindi na siya nakakaramdam ng ganoon para kay Kerky. Graduate na dapat siya sa mga sensations na ganoon. She sighed. If those things that she felt yesterday while she was out on a date with him - happened
                                            ten years ago when she was still head over hills and over the mountains in love with Antonio Kerkmez - kaya niya pang tanggapin at i-deal. Pero ngayon, hindi na talaga katanggap-tanggap. It's been ten years.
                                            Dapat wala na ang lahat ng iyon, dapat nakalimot na siya, dapat galit siya. Pero hindi. She knew that Kerky was only playing with her, pero ang hindi niya maintindihan ay kung bakita nakakaramdam siya ng kasiyahan
                                            at kilig. Muli siyang napabuntong hininga. Yesterday, she felt like she was fifteen again - so naÃ¯ve, carefree, young, stupid and in love with Kerky. Ipinilig niya ang kanyang ulo. Hindi niya maiwasang maaalala
                                            ang mga bagay na ginawa niya noon mapansin lamang siya nito. She remembered one time that she volunteered to do his projects for him. Ginawa niya iyon hanggang sa umabot sa pagkakataon na siya mismong may katawan
                                            ay hindi nakapagpasa dahil mas inuna niyang gawin ang project nito. Halos sambahin niya ang lupang nilalakaran ni Kerky noon. At kung nabigyan lamang siya ng pagkakataon ay kaya niyang ibigay ang buong mundo
                                            dito. Pero bago pa man mangyari iyon ay binasag na nito ang pag-asa niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Nagmukha siyang tanga.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Nasaktan siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Nawasak ang kaisa-isang bagay na naging dahilan ng paggising niya sa umaaga.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">At hinding-hindi niya mapapatawad ang lalaking iyon!</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Ipinikit niya ang kanyang mga mata. She took a real deep breath. Pilit niyang kinakalma ang kanyang sarili. Alam niyang may posibilidad na maiyak siya at hindi niya hahayaang mangyari iyon. Nangako siya sa kanyang
                                            sarili na hinding-hindi na siya muling luluha para sa lalaking iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hindi na. Kahit kailan.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Tuloy ang plano, Hanna." Iyon ang winika niya sa kanyang sarili.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">about an hour ago Â· Like</p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Ghecela Marie Chris Chiuco --------------</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Gwapo na ba ko, bok?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kinakabahang humarap si Kerky kay Lex. Hindi niya maintindihan kung para saan ang kabog ng dibdib niya. Kinakabahan siya para sa isang bagay na hindi niya alam kung ano.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Gago! Kailan ka ba pumogi?" pang-aasar ng kaibigan. Inismiran niya ito at saka muling inayos ang kanyang t-shirt. It was a very sunny Saturday morning at nasa isang eco-park sila ni Lex.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Pagpapatuloy ito ng reunion nila na ginanap halos dalawang linggo na ang nakakaraan. Magkakaroon lang ng kauniting activities para sa araw na iyon tulad ng fun run, tree planting at isang benefit concert kung saan
                                            ang banda nila ang main event.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Tang ina! Kinakabahan ako eh!" usal niya. Nilingon niyang muli si Lex na sa pagkakataong iyon ay tumutungga ng bote ng tubig. Tinapunan siya nito ng tingin.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi na ko tinatablan ng kaba, bok." Nakangiting sabi nito. Umiling siya. Hindi na lamang siya kumibo. Muli niyang tinanaw ang entrance ng eco-park. May isang tao siyang hinihintay at ipinapanalangin niyang dumating
                                            sana. Gusto niya na muling makita si Hanna.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Halos dalawang linggo na rin ang nakalipas mula nang lumabas sila at hindi na muling nasundan iyon. Sayang nga. Nais niya sana muling makasama ito. Kakaiba kasi ang sayang nadarama niya sa tuwing maaalala niya ang
                                            mga moment na pinagsaluhan nilang dalawa.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ngingiti-ngiti ka diyan?" tanong ni Lex.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Wala noh." He said still smiling wide. Narinig niyang napapalatak ang kaibigan niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You have it bad."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"What?" he asked him. Lex eyed him like he was a specimen under a microscope then he grinned.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Go figure." Makahulugang sabi nito pagkatapos niyon ay tinalikuran siya nito. Takang-takang sinundan niya ng tingin si Alissandro.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Anong problema noon?" huminga siya ng malalalim at saka muling sinipat ang entrance ng eco-park. Padami na ng padami ang tao. Maya-maya lamang ay magsisimula na ang fun run. Tatakbo siya. Gusto rin naman niyang
                                            makatulong sa pagbabago ng mundo -pero bago iyon ay gusto muna niyang makita ang taong nagpapahinto ng kanyang mundo.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">And as if destiny was siding with him - bigla ay nakita niyang dumarating ang kanyang hinihintay. His smile froze when he saw Hanna entering the premises. Hindi niya alam kung paano nito nagagawa iyon - making his
                                            heart stop like that. From where he was standing he could see it very well. Hanna was indeed the most beautiful woman inside that park. She was only wearing her "Green is fun" t-shirt, her faded blue skinny
                                            jeans, and a pair of black and white converse but still she could make a show stopper entrance. Everything in his world turned slow and then it became slower when their eyes met. His world stopped when she smiled
                                            at him and finally his heart literally skipped a beat when she came over and said;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hi, Kerky!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"H-hello," nahigit niya ang kanyang hininga.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kanina ka pa?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Oo. Uhm.. hinihintay kita eh." Napakamot siya bigla ng ulo. Hanna looked at him. Saglit na kumunot ang kanyang noo. Bakit parang may nakita siyang galit sa mga mata ni Hanna?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Talaga?" she smiled again. "Na-miss mo ko noh?" sabi pa nito. Alam niyang sa pagkakataong iyon ay namumula ang kanyang pisngi. Hindi talaga niya maintindihan ang kanyang sarili. Sa dami ng nanging girlfriends niya
                                            ay si Hanna lamang ang nakapagpa-pula ng kanyang pisngi.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ano kasi..." panoo ba niya sasabihin? "Ano kasi, H-hanna, kasi -"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hoy! Tatakbo na tayo!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Naputol ang kanyang sasabihin nang marinig niya ang sigaw ni Calen. Tumingin siya sa direksyon nito at muli niyang ibinalik ang mga mata niya kay Hanna. He smiled nervously.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Tatakbo muna ako, ha? Tapos may sasabihin ako sa'yo pagbalik ko." Hindi na niya nagawang hintayin ang isasagot nito dahil muli na namang siyang tinawag ni Calen. He took one last look at Hanna and waved. He needed
                                            to tell her something, sana nga lang talaga maging maayos ang lahat.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">----------------</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hanna was evilly smiling as she watched Kerky with his pastel friends. Tuloy na tuloy na ang plano niya. Wala nang kahit na anong bagay ang makakapigil sa kanya. Revenge was sweet. She could already taste it now.
                                            Kerky looked at her direction. She smiled at him and wave. She pretended that she was actually cheering for him but the fact was, she was silently planning her next move.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">What was her next plan? She grinned. Kerky would know soon. And her gut feel was telling her that something good would actually happen today. Based on Kerky's behavior, she was so sure that something good as in
                                            really good would happen today.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">So she waited for the race to be over. Apparently, Kerky's friend Lex was the one who won the race. She stared at them. Hinintay niya na dumako ang tingin ni Kerky sa kanya. Maya-maya lamang ay bigla itong nagbaling
                                            ng direksyon sa kanya. Muli niyang itinaas ang kanyang kamay upang kawayan ito. Kerky waved back. Ngumiti siya ngunit agad na napalis ang ngiting iyon when she realized that he wasn't waving at him. Sinundan
                                            niya ang tingin nito.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Her mouth fell open when she saw a woman with a long hair - wearing a plain white shirt paired with a brown cargo pants and a pair of a really - as in - really old sneakers making her way towards Kerky. They embraced
                                            each other. Bigla ay naikuyom niya ang kanyang mga kamao.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">What the hell was happening? He said that he intend to make her fall for him in the span of two months? Anong nangyayari? Who the hell was this woman and why was he hugging Antonio Harvey Kerkmez?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Tiim ang mga bagang na nilapitan niya ang dalawa. Walang karapatan ang babaeng iyon na hawakan ang pag-aari niya. Oo, pag-aari. Kerky was hers. At hanggang hindi siya nakakapaghiganti dito ay hinding-hindi niya
                                            bibitiwan ang mokong na iyon!</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kerky," mariing tawag niya. Naghiwalay ang mga ito upang sinuhin siya. Kerky smiled when he saw her habang siya naman ay tinititigan mula ulo hanggang paa ang mapang-ahas na babaeng iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hi," she said still gritting her teeth.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hello," the woman said to her. "I'm Ian. The Pastel's RM." Inabot ng babae ang kamay nito sa kanya. Tiningnan niya lamang iyon. Reluctantly, the woman named Ian withdrew her hand and stared at her too.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"RM? What the hell does that mean?" humalukipkip siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Teka, teka lang..." sabat ni Kerky. Binalingan nito ang babae. "Ian, usap na lang tayo mamaya ha? Text na lang kita." Naramdaman niya ang kamay ni Kerky sa kanyang braso. Tila hinahatak siya nito patungo sa kung
                                            saan. Inirapan niya si Kerky. Gusto sana niyang itanong dito kung bakit kailangan niya pang i-text ang babaeng iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Sino ba iyon?" hindi mapigilang tanong niya. Lumiko sila ni Kerky. Maya-maya ay natagpuan niya ang sarili niya sa ilalim ng isang malaking puno. Kerky let go of her arm.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Si Ian iyon." Tiningnan niya ang mukha ng kausap. Kerky's face lacked emotion. Tahimik ito, pero hindi naman mukhang galit ngunit hindi rin ito mukhang masaya. He was just standing in front of her looking at her
                                            intently.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You're jealous." Walang kaabog-abog na wika nito. Nanlaki ang kanyang mga mata. Selos? At bakit siya makakaramdam ng selos? Walang selosan na nangyayari dito. Hindi niya lang talaga gusto na makita si Kerky kasama
                                            ang ibang babae habang naghihiganti siya rito. Kerky must feel what she had felt the night after he pulled that trick on her.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I am NOT jealous!" sigaw niya rito. "Why would I be jealous?! I'm not even your -------"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She didn't have the chance to finish the sentence she started because with a blink of an eye, Kerky's lips crushed hers. She was wide eyed. Hindi niya alam kung anong gagawin. Sa una ay nakalapat lamang ang labi
                                            ni Kerky sa kanyang mga labi ngunit nahigit nita ang kanyang hininga nang magsimula ang paggalaw nito. He started giving her a real kiss. Every brush, every movement of his lips agains't her make her knees wobbly.
                                            It was as if they were turning into jelly knees. Hindi niya alam kung anong gagawin, Should she kiss Kerky back? But, how would she do that if she didn't know how to? It was her actual real first ever kiss!
                                            At hindi siya makapaniwala na kay Kerky pa - of all people - si Kerky pa ang magbibigay ng unang halik sa kanya!</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">A while later, Kerky released her. Idinikit nito ang noo niya sa noon ito. His eyes were still closed and an amused smile was drawn on his face.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I've always wanted to do that..." wika nito habang nakapikit pa rin.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She stared at him.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">He. Always. Wanted. To. Do. That.?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">What the hell?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Pilit siyang lumayo kay Kerky at saka pinadapo ang kanang kamay niya sa kaliwang pisngi nito, Kerky's expression after the slap she gave him was comical. Nakaawang ang labi nito na para bang hindi makapaniwala sa
                                            naganap. She tried composing herself. Pilit niyang kinalma ang kanyang sarili kahit na sa kaloob-looban ng kanyang buong pagkatao ay gusto niyang saktan ang lalaking ito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hanna?!" nagtatanong ang mnga mata nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"How dare you kiss me!" she said. Hindi na niya napigilan. Her tears just started flowing out. She couldn't accept the fact that Kerky - the man she hated with every cells and bones in her body - was actually her
                                            first kiss.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hanna..." he tried reaching her hand. Lumayo siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I hate you!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She turned her back and run away. Her tears were still flowing on the other hand she was confused. She got in her car and drove away. Iniisip niya pa rin si Kerky at ang unang halik na ninakaw nito sa kanya. Ang
                                            kapal ng mukha ng lalaking iyon! Wala siyang karapatan para ganituhin siya! He was making her question her feelings for him. Her heart was telling her that it wasn't just for revenge na may iba nang meaning
                                            ang kasiyahang nararamdaman niya sa tuwing maaalala niya ito. Ilang araw pa lang silang nagkikita pero parang nanunumbalik na naman ang nararamdaman niya dito noon. At hinding-hindi niya iyon hahayaang mangyari.
                                            Hindi na siya magpapakatanga kay Kerky kahit kailan.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Inis na inis si Hanna habang pinanonood niya ang music video ng The Pastels sa Youtube. She was biting her nails while she looked at Kerky at the monitor of her laptop. Kahit nasa malayo ito at hindi niya talaga
                                            maabot ay nakadarama siya ng urge para muling sampalin ang mukha nitongt nakakainis.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Anong karapatan niyang halikan ako?!" gigil na gigil na tanong niya. Inis na inis na isinara niya ang laptop at saka tumayo. Nagpalakad-lakad siya sa loob ng kwarto. Hanggang ngayon, kahit ayaw niya ay nararamdaman
                                            pa rin niya ang bawat hagod ng mga labi ni Kerky sa kanya - at ang mas kinaiinis niya pa ay ang katotohanan na nakakaramdam siya ng kilig. Kung ang utak niya ay nandiri sa nangyari, ang puso naman niya ay naghuhumiyaw
                                            sa tuwa!</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Argghhhh!" nagpapapadyak na sigaw niya. Iyon ang hitsura niya nang mapasukan siya ng kanyang Mama. Her mother looked at her, bigla ay napaupo siya.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Sweetie, what's wrong?" her mother asked her. She pouted her lips. Siya ang bunso sa tatlong magkakapatid kung kaya't sa tuwing kakaiba ang reaksyon ngt kanyang mukha ay kaagad na nag-aalala ang kanyang Mama.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"W-wala po. Don't mind me," she sighed. Napapailing ang Mama niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Oo nga pala, may nagpadala ng yellow roses sa'yo." mula sa likuran ng Mama niya ay lumabas si Inday dala ang isang boquet ng dilaw na rosas. Her mouth fell open. Ang ganda ng flower arrangements. Agad siyang napatayo
                                            at lumapit sa kasambahay.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kanino galing?" she had no idea kung sino ang magpapadala sa kanya ng ganitong klaseng bulaklak. Ngunit bigla ay parang alam na niya kung sino. She immediately took the card and opened it. Ganoon na lang ang disappointment
                                            niya when she realized that the flowers were from Keir and not from Kerky. Sumabog na naman ang labi niya. Muli siyang bumalik sa kinauupuan niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kanino galing?" tanong ng mama niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kay Kier." matipid niyang sagot.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Your father likes that boy. He's polite." komento pa nito. Tinitigan niya ang Mama niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Yeah, polite and boring." wala sa loob na sagot niya. She fell silent again. Her mid drifted off to that place where Kerky made her feel those things that she wasn't aware of. The feelings she didin't know existed
                                            inside her.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Mama..." huminga siya ng malalim. "What if there was a guy who made you look like a fool in front of every one... tapos ---" hindi na niya maituloy ang sinasabi. Nag-iwas siya ng tingin. Sa pagkakataong kasing
                                            iyon ay naisip niya na kasabay ng pagkamuhi niya kay Kerky ay ang katotohanan na gusto niya ito. Gusto niya pa rin ito hanggang ngayon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You like a guy?" her mother said amusingly.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"No!" nanlalaki ang mga matang tanggi niya. "I hate that guy! I hate him with every cells in my body!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Then, why are we talking about him?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Because...." nagyuko siya ng ulo. "I'm con-confused."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"About this boy?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"No!" she sighed. "Confused about what i want to do with him."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi kita maintindihan, Ayella Hanna." nagugulumihanang wika ng kanyang Mama.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ako din, Mama. Hindi ko rin maintindihan ang sarili ko."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Buti pa kumain ka na. Ikaw na lang ang hinihintay namin ng Papa mo. Sumunod ka na doon."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Napalabi siya. Ano ba kasing dapat niyang gawin kay Kerky? Hindi naman kasi niya naisip na magiging sagabal ang charms ng gunggong na iyon sa mga plano niya. Hindi naman niya naisip na maaapektuhan siya ng karismang
                                            taglay nito. He was playing with her and she was actually playing along kahit ayaw niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She wanted to smash her face but she couldn't. She sighed. Tumayo na siya upang bumaba sa dining area nang mag-ring sang cellphone niya. Agad niya iyong sinagot.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"H-hello?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Wala siyang narinig na boses. Kumunot ang noo niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hello?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Please... look out your window."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Matapos ang mga salitang iyon ay natapos ang tawag. Ikinakunot iyon ng kanyang noon. Anong problema ng taong tumawag sa kanya? Whoever called her wanted her to look out her window. She was so puzzled. Sino ang wala
                                            sa huwisyong tatawag sa kanya para sabihin na dumungaw siya sa bintana? That was the weirdest message she had ever recieved.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Nais sana niyang isantabi na lang ang natanggap na tawag, pero dahil sa writer siya ay umiral ang kanyang writer's instinct. She wanted to know who called her. Probably, whoever it was, nandoon ito sa may bintana
                                            niya. Ayaw niyang mag-isip ng kung ano. Slowly, she walked towards her window and when she pushed away her curtains, she saw the biggest surprise of her life.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">There in front of there house, in the middle of the street was Antonio Harvey Kerkmez, holding a bunch of yellow roses looking up on her with that sad look on his face. Her mouth literally fell open as she look
                                            at Kerky who was looking up.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"W-what are you doing?" she asked. Hindi siya makapaniwala. Anong ginagawa ni Kerky sa harapan ng bahay ng mga magulang niya? Paano nito nalaman kung nasaan siya at para saan ang dramang ito? She bit her lower lip.
                                            She was, again getting excited. Kitang-kita niya ngayon sa kanyang harapan ang bunga ng lahat ng sama ng loob niya. She knew that moment while she was looking at Kerky, she had him. At kayang-kaya na niya itong
                                            paikutin sa kanyang mga palad.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"H-hanna..." he started. "Ano, ano.."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi kita marinig. Teka bababa ako." she said smiling. She turned away from the mirror and walked to the door. Hindi niya maipaliwanag ang kasiyahang nararamdaman niya. Basta masaya siya. Masaya siya dahil nandito
                                            si Kerky at dahil nandito si Kerky ay alam na alam na niya na pwede na niyang isagawa ang mga plano niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Make Kerky head over hill and over the mountain in love and push him off the cliff.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Iyon ang mantra na paulit-ulit na sinasabi niya sa kanyang sarili. Mabilis na tinahak niyang ang pintuan. Gagawin niya ngayong araw ang step one. She grinned. After today, mababaliw si Kerky. After today, he'll
                                            be on ker palms - right where she wanted him to be.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kerky!" malambing na bungad niya rito matapos niyang mabuksan ang gate. Agad itong humarap sa kanya. She tiptoed while moving closer to him,</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"H-hi..." he nervously smiled at her.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"A-anong ginagawa mo dito?" pagkatamis-tamis ng ngiting ibinigay niya rito. Nagkibit-balikat si Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"The last time we saw each other you said that you hate me." nagbuntong hininga ito. "I d-don't want you to hate me, Hanna."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"B-but I d-don't hate you."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kerky's eyes widened with awe. Nginitian niya ito. Kung iisipin ay nakakatuwa ang reaksyon nito. She wanted to laugh. Sino ngayon ang gullible sa kanilang dalawa?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"But you said---"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Shh!" agad niyang pinutol ang sinasabi nito. "I said things I know, pero nadala lang ako. I was caught off guard you see." she smiled sweetly.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You were?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She rolled her eyes.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Are you going to answer me with another question?" humalukipkip siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I'm sorry." nagyuko ito ng ulo. Napailing siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Okay lang..." she paused for a while. "But... did you really meant it when you said that you've been wanting to do that to me?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kerky stared at her for a while. Parang hindi nito alam kung anong isasagot sa kanya. Hindi niya maintindihan kung bakit ganoon na lamang ang kasiyahan niya. Ayaw na rin naman niyang alamin. Basta ang mahalaga ay
                                            hawak na niya sa leeg ang lalaking kinamumuhian niya.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I meant everything I said, Hanna. Since the first time I saw you at the reunion - the apology, what I said on the date and what I said after kissing you." he sighed. "You see, Ms. Mendonza, if you haven't notice,
                                            I really, really like you. Big time. I like you very much that I was always thinking about that brief moment when our lips met and the sensation I felt while our lips were locked in a very sweet but compromising
                                            position. I like you a lot."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You do?" she asked. Her eyes were wide, her palms were sweaty and her heart was beating fast.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I do.." he moved forward until they were just inches away from each other.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She took a deep breath, looked Kerky in the eye.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Bahala na si Superman.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">This was all part of her plan.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Then kiss me, Kerky. Kiss me."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">========================</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kerky couldn't believe his luck. He went to Hanna not really sure of what was going to happen and now, she was practically asking him to kiss her. He was just looking at her. Nabibingi na ba siya dahil sa lakad
                                            ng tibok ng puso niya? Huminga siya ng malalim. Hindi niya alam kung anong meron kay Hanna at nagagawa nitong patibukin ng mabilis ang puso niya. Sabi ni Lex, hyphothalamus ang may kasalanan sa mga emosyong
                                            nararamdaman niya para kay Hanna, pero sa bilis ng tibok ng puso niya ay parang hindi naman totoo ang sinasabi ng kanyang kaibigan.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kiss me, Kerky." she said again. He took a deep, deep breath, held Hanna's shoulders, pulled her closer and kissed her fully on the mouth.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">He was aiming for a sweet, light kiss, but then he went into frenzy when Hanna's lips started imitating his every move. She was kissing him back! He realized that he needed to make this kiss longer and sweeter and
                                            memorable. He wanted Hanna to remember this, He wanted Hanna to forget about his first kiss. He wanted to be Hanna's first kiss.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Finally, after some minutes, he let her go. He looked at Hanna's face, there was a smile on her sweet, pretty lips.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"How was it?" he asked her. She bit her lower lip before looking at him.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Sweet." halos tumalon siya sa tuwa sa narinig niyang sinabi nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Paano ngayon iyan?" muling tanong niya. Kumunot ang maganda nitong noo.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Anong paano na ngayon?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Naghalikan na tayo. Ibig sabihin girlfriend na kita." malambing na wika niya. Nakita niyang tumaas ang kilay ni Hanna habang nakatingin sa kanya. Ikinapagtaka niya ang galit na nakita niya sa mga mata nito. Galit
                                            ba iyon? Bakit naman siya magagalit sa kanya? Nawala ang galit sa mga mata ni Hanna nang ito ay ngumiti.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi mo naman ako niligawan eh. Saka wala pang two months."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi ba?" ipinakita niya rito ang dilaw na rosas na hawak niya. "Ito may flowers ako. Tapos ide-date ulit kita. Tapos dadalawin kita dito sa bahay mo. Tapos---"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Oo na. Ang kulit mo naman eh."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kinuha nito mula sa mga kamay niya ang rosas at nakangiting inamoy iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Tayo na?" he asked.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"O-oo..." she answered.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"YES!" hindi niya napigilan ang pagsigaw at pagtalon. May girlfriend na siya! "Girlfriend na kita! Yes! Yes! Yes!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hoy! Ano ka ba?!" naramdaman niya ang kamay ni Hanna sa kanyang balikat. Humarap siya sa kanyang bagong kasintahan at hinawakan ang mukha nito. Ginawaran niya si Hanna ng isang matamis na halik. He was so happy!</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi kita papaiyakin." nakangiting sabi niya. Hanna grinned at him.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kerky, kung may iiyak sa relasyong ito, sisiguraduhin kong hindi ako iyon."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Saglit siyang natigilan. May kung anong kilabot na hatid ang boses na iyon ni Hanna. May ibig ba siyang iparating?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"So...you have a girlfriend."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Inirapan ni Kerky si Calen habang inaayos ang gitarang kinina niya pa hawak. Aburido siya nang araw na iyon. Today was supposed to be their second monthsarry and he would really love to spend the day with Hanna
                                            -- his girlfriend pero missing in action na naman ang babaeng iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hindi niya maintindihan kung anong nangyayari. Noong araw na sinagot siya ni Hanna ay maayos naman sila. The following week ay napaka-sweet pa nito sa kanya. Halos araw-araw siya nitong tinatawagan, tine-text at
                                            palagi nitong sinasabing "I miss you, honey..." Pero matapos ang ilang araw ay parang nagbago ang lahat.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Bigla ay parang lumayo ang loob ni Hanna sa kanya. He tried asking her what the problem was pero ang sabi lang nito ay busy ito sa trabaho. Sinubukan naman niyang intindihin iyon, OO nga naman. Demanding ang trabahon
                                            nito at hindi ito basta-basta pwedeng hindi pumasok.Inintindi niya iyon. Iniisip niya lagi na busy langt si Hanna at darating din ang oras na magkakaroon na sila ng time sa isa't-isa. Then, dumating iyong first
                                            monthsary na pinaghandaan niya ng sobra., He wanted their monthsary to be special and memorable so he planned it very well. Tinawagan niya ito upang sabihin na may surpresa siya rito. He gave her the address
                                            and the name of the restaurant. Ang sabi nito ay pupunta ito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Naghanda siya ng dinner date para kay Hanna -- with matching candles, roses scattered on the floor, floating lights on the pool, expensive wine he even paid an orchestra group to sing at their date --- pero namuti
                                            lang ang mata niya -- hindi naman dumating si Hanna.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hindi niya maipaliwanag ang naramdaman niya noon. Nasaktan siya. He felt so worthless. Ni hindi man lang nga siya naalalang batiin ni Hanna ng happy monthsary. Ang sama ng loob niya noon. Huwag naman sabihin ni
                                            Hanna na nakalimutan nito ang monthsary niya. Parang hindi naman kasi kapani-paniwala iyon. Kailan pa nakalimot ang isang babae sa monthsary? Iyong ibang magkasintahan nga inaaway ng girlfriend dahil nakakalimutan
                                            iyongm monthsary pero si Hanna -- nakalimutan nga ba niya?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Lalong sumama ang loob niya nang kinabukasan ay wala siyang narinig na kahit na ano mula rito. Ni hindi ito nagtext sa kanya. Ni walang "Sorry, hon. Hindi kita napuntahan." Buong umaga niyang hinihintaya ng text
                                            ni Hanna pero wala. Hindi na niya natiis, pinuntahan niya ito sa trabaho. And there, he saw her with that guy -- Kier --- they were having coffee sa tapat ng T.V. Station na pinagta-trabahuhan ni Hanna. Thery
                                            seemed to know each other very well. Nakaramdam siya ng selos at dahil sa selos na naramdaman niya ay pinuntahan niya ang mga ito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Nakita naman niyang agad na ngumiti si Hanna nang makita siya pero ang ikinapikon niya talaga ay nang ipakilala siya nito sa Keir na iyon bilang "si Kerky -- friend ko." Nag-iinit talaga ang ulo niya tuwing naaalala
                                            niya ang tagpong iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Pare!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Naramdaman niya ang biglang pag-akbay sa kanya ni Calen. Huminga siya ng malalim at saka ibinaba ang gitara. Inis na inis siya. Kaninang umaga niya pa hinihintay ang tawag ni Hanna pero ni ha, ni ho ay wala siyang
                                            narinig dito. Naisip kasi niya na kung hindi niya ito babatiin ng happy monthsary ay baka ito ang makaalala sa okasyon pero parang hindi naman mangyayari iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Pare?" sa pagkakataong iyon ay nagtataka na ang tono ni Calen. Tumingin lang siya sa mga ito at saka tumalikod. Lumabas siya ng studio seven kung saan sila nagre-rehearse. Nakakaramdam siya ng pagkadismaya. Ano
                                            bang nangyayari sa relasyon niya kay Hanna? Parang... parang wala siyang girlfriend.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kokey!" agad niyang nilingon ang nagsalita. He found Jenny walking towards him. Tulad nang palagi niyang nakikita ay nakangiti ito sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Anong problema mo?" tanong nito. Umiling siya. Umupo siya sa isa sa mga waiting chairs roon. Sumunod ito sa kanya.</p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"May girlfriend na ako..."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Di maganda, eh bakit sambakol iyang mukha mo?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Para kasing di naman niya ako mahal."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Huminga si ng malalim. Iyon ang kanyang nararamdaman sa ngayon. Hindi na niya kayang itanggi pa sa kanyang sarili. Parang hindi naman siya mahal ni Hanna.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Nag-usap na ba kayo?" tanong ni Jenny. Umiling siya. "Kausapin mo, baka naman may issue lang."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Paano ko gagawin iyon eh ni hindi nga niya naaalalang batiin ako. Monthsary namin ngayon. Pero ni text wala."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Malay mo may surprise siya sa'yo o baka naman nakalimutan niya lang." tiningnan niya si Jenny.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ikaw Jenny, babae ka. Makakalimutan mo ba ang monthsary ninyo ni Trey?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Saglit na natahimik ang kanyang kausap. Maya-maya ay umiling ito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kita mo na." muli siyang tumayo. He just feel so worthless. His own girlfriend doesn't miss him. She doesn't think about him the way he thinks about her. Minsan iniisip niya kung bakit ba siya sinagot ni Hanna.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Huy, saan ka pupunta?" narinig niyang tanong ni Jenny. Hindi siya sumagot. He just kept on walking until he found himself in the parking lot. He took his car and drove away. He was feeling so lost...</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">------------------</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"O.T. again?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Nalukot ang mukha ni Hanna nang marinig niya ang tanong na iyon ni Keir. Hindi pa ba obvious na overtime siya at hindi siya uuwin ngayon. She calmed herself and looked at him.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I'm very busy so why don't you just go away?" hindi niya alam kung bakit ang kulit-kulit ni Keir sa kanya. Ilang beses na niyang sinabi na wala itong pag-asa sa kanya pero pilit pa rin ito ng pilit. Alam kasi nito
                                            na gusto siya ng Papa niya kung kaya ganoon na lang ang tyaga nito. Imbyerna siya sa lalaking ito. Kahit kailan naman ay hindi siya pumayag sa panliligaw scheme nito. Napabuntong hininga siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ang sungit mo naman. Anyway, I would really love to take you to dinner." muling sabi nito. Napailing siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Keir... please --"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"As friends, okay?" napatingin siya dito. As friends? Tinimbang niya ang sinabi nito. Kier gives him flowers, nanliligaw ito sa kanya tapos ngayon ay gusto nitong lumabas as friends?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Napanguso siya...</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Bigla ay pumasok sa isip niya si Kerky. Today was supposed to be their monthsary, pero dahil kasama san paghihiganti niya ang pambabalewala dito ay hindi niya iyon iniintindi. Alam niyang naghihintay ito ng tawag
                                            at text mula sa kanya pero patitigasan niyang hindi siya tatawag o magtetext dito. Mamumuti ang mata nito sa kakahintay san kanya tulad nang nangyari noong first monthsary nila. Sinandya niyang kalimutan ang
                                            araw na iyon. She wanted to make Kerky feel the things she felt back when she was still kin love with him -- back when she was still freaky Hanna...</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Alright.." sagot niya kay Keir. "Pero this is not a date and share tayo sa bayad."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Whatever you say... Come" nakangiting kinuha niya ang bag niya at sumunod kay Keir. Kung tutuusin ay mas gwapo si Keir kay Kerky. Mas maayos itong manamit. Laging formal ito at kahit kailan ay hindi niya nakitang
                                            nawalan ito sa composure habang si Kerky naman --- Mowhawk. Buhok pa lang nito sablay na agad at kung manamit ito ay parang gusgusing bata. He was always waering those rugged jeans and old pair of sneakers tapos
                                            plain white shirt or minsan band tshirts na parang laging kailangan ng laba.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Sumakay sila sa kotse ni Keir. They ended up having dinner in a fancy restaurant. Tulad noon ay trabaho lang ang pinag-uusapan nila ni Keir dahil sa tuwing ililisya nito ang usapan sa kanilang dalawa ay ininiba
                                            niya ang topic. After a while, Kier asked for the bill and they let the restaurant. Inaya naman siya nitong magkape at pumayag siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Habang nasa loob ng coffee shop ay hindi niya maiwasang ikumpara si Keir kay Kerky. At sa lahat ng bagay ay mas nakakalamang si Kier.. ang hindi lang niya maintindihan ay kung bakit hindi niya magawang ibigay ang
                                            gusto nito.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Penny for your thoughts?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Saglit siyang natigilan nang maulinigan ang tinig ni Kier. Bakit nga ba naiisip niya si Kerky? Dapat ay hindi ito pumapasok sa isipan niya. Dapat ay hindi siya apektado ng charms nito lalo na ngayon na wala naman
                                            ito sa harapan niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I..." she sighed. "I need to go back to the office."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Sure?" tanong pa nito sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Yeah, kailangan kong tapusin iyong reports para kay Meg bukas."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hindi niya alam kung para saan ang guilt na nararamdaman niya. Nagi-guilty siya dahil nakipag-dinner siya kay Kier at hindi niya ininitindi ang monthsary nila ni Kerky? Hindi. Hindi dapat siya nakakaramdam ng ganon.
                                            She should be happy especially ngayon na alam niyang hindi maipinta ang hitsura nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Inihatid siya ni Kier sa labas ng kanilang office. Ipinagbukas pa siya nito ng pintuan ng kotse at saka nakangiting humarap sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I had fun. Thanks, Hanna." he said after that, he bent down and gave her a kiss on her left cheek. Hindi niya inaasahan iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">After that, he just left. Nakaawang pa rin ang kanyang mga labing sinundan niya ng tingin si Kier.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">What the hell? Why would he do something like that? Hindi naman kasali iyon sa usapan. That was crossing the line! Kung nagkaroon lang siya ng pagkakataon ay sinampal na sana niya ito. Naiinis na tumalikod siya
                                            at tinungo ang daan papasok sa building ng kanilang office. She was busy trying to collect her composure when she noticed a figure standing near the entrance door.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She stopped dead. Dahan-dahan siyang nag-angat ng paningin. There, she saw the last person she wanted to see that night. Ilang beses siyang napalunok...</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"K-kerky..."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hindi nagsalita si Kerky. He just stood there looking at her like she was something else. Nakita niyang may hawak itong isang boquet ng tulips.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"A-anong ginagawa mo dito?" kumabog ang kanyang dibdib. Gusto niyang batukan ang kanyang sarili. Was Kerky standing there the whole time? Did he see Kier kissed her on her cheeks? Bakit hindi ito nagsalita? And
                                            why the hell was she feeling guilty. As far as she knows, wala naman siyang ginawang masama.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Lumapit si Kerky sa kanya at ibinigay ang bulaklak na hawak nito. She was waiting for him to say something bad, something that could tear her soul apart but he just said:</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Happy Monthsary."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">After saying those words, he just walked away. Sinundan niya ng tingin ito. Gusto niyang tawagin si Keky. Gusto niya mag-sorry pero naisip niya, bakit niya gagawin iyon? Wala naman siyang ginawang masama. She stood
                                            there watching him as he walk away. In her head she was saying: This is all a apart of a plan...</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Ang masaktan si Kerky. Ang magmukha itong tanga...</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Pero bakit parang nasasaktan rin siya?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Please be my baby.. make me your baby...</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kerky looked at his phone. Hindi na niya mabilang kung ilang beses ng tumunog iyon nang gabing iyon at sa tuwing mangyayari iyon ay napapabunting hininga siya. Hanna kept on calling him pero hindi naman niya sinasagot
                                            ang tawag nito. Napailing siya. Ngayon pa ba siya nito tatawagah kung kailan natapos na ang monthsary nila at kung kailan inis na inis siya sa lalaking humalik sa pisngi ng girlfriend niya?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hindi siya galit kay Hanna. Nagtatampo siya rito, pero hindi siya galit. Masama lamang ang kanyang loob sapagkat binebale-wala siya nito. Pero kahit anong gawin niya ay hindi niya magawang magalit rito. Ang kaso,
                                            galit na galit na galit naman siya sa lalaking iyon! Muli na naman siyang napabuntong hininga. Napag-alaman niyang kasama pala ni Hanna ang lalaking iyon sa trabaho. Ang hindi lang talaga niya maintindihan ay
                                            kung bakit biglang nagbago si Hanna sa kanya. Hindi naman ito ganoon noong bagu-bago pa lang ang kanilang relasyon pagkatapos ay bigla na lang itong nanlamig. He wanted to figure her out. He wanted to understand
                                            why she was acting that way but how could he do that if she doesn't even want to talk to him.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Okay ka lang ba, Kerky?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Iyon ang madalas itanong sa kanya ngayon ng kanyang mga kaibigan. They were all wondering if he was indeed okay - even Nathan - their former bandmate - called him last night just to check on him.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kerky, sabihin mo na kung anong problema mo. Baka mamaya mabaliw ka na lang basta diyan." ani Calen. He sighed and stood up. They were inside Revert Record's conference room, may meeting sana sila ukol sa gagawing
                                            panibagong music video, they were just waiting for Rika and Anton to arrive.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I'm good." pagkasabi niyon ay biglang bumukas ang pinto. Iniluwa noon si Rika kasunod ang dalawang babaeng parehong nakasalamin.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Everyone this is Roba Shapiro and her assitant Gianne Alejo - you'll be working with them on your next video and photoshoot. Guys, this is The Pastels. The twins, Calen and Caleb, Lex and Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hi..." malungkot na sabi niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Oh my god." Rika said while looking at him. "You said hi and just like that, I want to die." nakahawak sa dibdib na wika nito. Nagtawanan ang mga tao sa kanyang paligid. He tried smiling but he just couldn't. Not
                                            while Hanna was on his mind.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">The meeting started. Hindi naman siya nakikinig. He was there but it was as if he didn't really existed. No one dared to ask him a question. Kung siya ang tatanungin, hindi naman niya gusto ang mapunta sa lugar
                                            na iyon. He wanted to be someplace else, somewhere where he could be with Hanna.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I'm sorry..." walang kaabog-abog na tumayo siya. Alam niyang tinitingnan siya ng masama ni Rika at alam niyang nagtataka sa kanya ang kanyang mga kasama but he doesn't give a damn. Hindi na niya kayang tiisin ang
                                            ilang araw pang darating na hindi niya nakikita si Hanna.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Tanga na kung tanga pero kailangan niyang makita ito. Hindi na niya kayang makipagtikisan pa sa babaeng iyon. He felt like he would die just like that if another day passes by without being able to see her or talk
                                            to her.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Tinahak niya ang daan palabas ng building na iyon. He went to the parking lot, took out his keys, get in his car and drive like there's no tomorrow. He needed to get out there. He needed to be where he wanted to
                                            be and that place was nowhere but near Hanna.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">======</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Dinadasalan mo ba ang bawat butil ng kanin na isinusubo mo, Hanna?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Huminga ng malalim si Hanna bago niya itinulk palayo mula sa kanya ang pagkaing kanina niya pa pinaglalaruan. Masama ang pakiramdam niya. Ilang araw na siyang ganoon. Hindi niya alam kung magkakasakit ba siya o
                                            dahil iyon sa ginawa niya kay Kerky. She sighed. Kahit pala gaano kalaki ang galit niya sa lalaking iyon ay hindi maiiwasan na tubuan siya ng konsensya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She felt guilty. Parang gusto niyang saktan ang kanyang sarili. Hindi yata talaga niya makakalimutan ang gabing iyon lalo na ang saglit na hapdi na nakita niya sa mukha ni Kerky. Hindi niya makalimutan ang lungkot
                                            na nakita niya sa mukha nito. At kahit ilang beses niyang sabihin na wala pa iyon sa kalahati ng naramdaman niya noon dahil dito ay hindi niya makumbinsi ang kanyang sarili. Naisip niyang talagang mabait siyang
                                            tao. Kahit galit na galit siya kay Kerky ay naaawa naman siya dito. Paano ba naman siya makakpaghiganti ng maayos?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ano bang problema?" tanong ni Menchie.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Wala." sagot niya. Inirapan siya nito. Umiling siya at saka biglang tumayo. She needed some air. She needed some cigarrette. Maybe that would do the trick of calming her nerves.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Pumunta siya sa smoking area ng building nila. She stood there while puffing. Napailing siya. Kerky really brings the worst out of her. Matagal na siyang tumigil sa paninigarilyo pero ngayon ay ginagawa na naman
                                            niya. Hindi talaga siya mapakali. Gusto niyang kausapin si Kerky pero ano naman ang sasabihin niya rito?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Minsan ay gusto na talaga niyang sabunutan ang kanyang sarili.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Matapos ang ilang minuto ay naubos na niya ang isang stick. She headed back to the main building only to be surprised of the sight she saw at the hallway. Bakit nagkakagulo ang mga babaeng iyon? Anong meron? Hindi
                                            na sana niya papansinin ang komosyong iyon ngunit may nahagip na kung ano ang kanyang mga mata.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Isang pamilyar na bulto.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hindi man niya ito masyadong makita ngunit sa naging pagtakbo ng tibok ng puso niya at ang panginginig ng tuhof niya ay may ideya na siya kung sino ang pinagkakaguluhan ng mga babaeng iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Her mouth fell open when she saw Kerky emerged from the pool of girls surrounding him.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Their eyes locked. She could hear carpenters hammering through her heart. Unti-unting lumalapit sa kanya si Kerky and the fact that her heart was beating faster by the moment drives her crazy.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Anong problema niya?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Inilang hakbang ni Kerky ang distansyang namamagitan sa kanilang dalawa. Her eyes widened when she felt his hands wrapped around her waist. He pulled her closer and looked at her eye to eye.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I missed you." madamdaming sabi nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ker--"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She wasn't able to finish her sentence because Kerky's lips landed in hers. Nanlalaki ang mga matang hindi siya makapaniwala. Kerky was kissing her. Yes! They kissed before but this kiss was different. It was passionate
                                            and loving and twitterpattering and... her knees were melting, her limbs quievering. How could he possibly do that to her?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">After a while, Kerky ended the kiss. Idinikit nito ang kanyang noo sa noo nito. He;s eyes were still closed.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I don't care if you don't care about me or if you don't love me, Hanna, because right now, nothing matters but the fact that I'm so in love with you, I'm willing to be crap just so I could be with you..."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Pwede ba Kerky, huwag kang mageskandalo dito?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Bahagyang itinulak ni Hanna si Kerky. Tiningnan niya si Hanna na para bang hindi siya makapaniwala sa nagaganap. She actually thinks that he was making a scene? Kailan pa naging eskandalo ang pagsasabi ng "I love
                                            you" sa girlfriend niya? Hindi naman na kasi niya kayang itanggi sa kanyang sarili. Kaya ng siya nagkakaganito, kaya nga hindi siya mapakali sa tuwing hindi niya ito nakikita, kaya nga hnasasaktan siya sa pambabale-walang
                                            ginagawa nito sa kanya. Mahal niya ito. He was in love with Hanna. Hindi naman niya ginusto na mahalin ang babaeng parang hindi naman siya mahal at hindi siya binibigyan ng halaga ay wala naman na siyang magagawa.
                                            He fell in love with Hanna, deep and hard and he couldn't take his heart back anymore.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I'm not making a scene." he said. Damang-dama niya ang sakit sa kanyang puso. "I just want you to know how much you mean to me. I love you. We never said it to each other before and now, I'm telling you. I love
                                            you." Pilit niyang hinuhuli ang mga mata ni Hanna. Nag-iwas ito ng tingin sa kanya. He tried holding her pero tinabig nito ang kanyang kamay.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ano ba?!" she screamed at him. "Why don't you just leave?!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">He stepped backward. Why is she doing this to him? She was asking him to leave? Tiningnan niya si Hanna mula ulo hanggang paa. Then he smirked.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You don't love me." he said. It wasn't a question. It was a fact, a statement. It was the truth. Iyong katotohanan na hindi niya kayang aminin sa kanyang sarili. Hindi siya mahal ni Hanna. Wala itong nararamdaman
                                            para sa kanya. Pero bakit siya nito sinagot kung wala pala itong nararamdaman para sa kanya? Naawa lang ba ito sa kanya or was it because of something else? Kung anuman iyon ay ayaw na niyang alam sapagkat lubos
                                            lang naman siyang masasaktan kung sakali man na marinig niya. Tama na iyong hindi siya nito mahal. Tama na iyong wala siyang halaga rito. Hindi na niya gustong marinig kung bakit. All he knew right now was how
                                            painful it was to know that the one you love doesn't love you back.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Umalis ka na, Kerky." mariing sabi ni Hanna sa kanya. Napailing siya. Hindi niya masyadong naiintindihan ang nangyayari. ang tanging alam lang niya ay masakit sa pakiramdam ang lahat. He found himself walking aimlessly
                                            at the sidewalks of the metro. Hindi na niya alam kung gaano na kalayo ang kanyang nalakad. All he could think about was that cold expression Hanna had on her face noong pinaaalis siya nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Ang hirap tanggapin na hindi siya nito mahal.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kerky?" isang tining ang nagbalik sa kanya sa reyalidad ng buhay. He looked up and there he saw Nathan. Nagulat siya nang makita ito. He looked around him and he realized that he was inside a hospital, he was standing
                                            in front of Nathan's clinic. Tulad niya ay mukhang nagulat rin ito. He smiled.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bok..." he said to him. Nathan used to be a Pastel. But he had to leave the band for good because he wanted to pursue his medical career. Now, Nathan's one of the most renowned neuro surgeon in the country.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bok, anong ginagawa mo dito?" Nathan asked him. He shook his head. Niluwagan ni Nathan ang bukas ng pintuan ng clinic nito at saka binalingan ang secretary. "Cancel all my appointments today." matapos iyon ay isinara
                                            nito ang pinto.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kerky sat on the couch near Nathan's table. Mukha namang alalang-alala sa kanya ang kaibigan niya. Humatak ito ng silya at saka umupo sa harapan niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You look shit, Kerks. What the hell happen?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I'm in love." he said flatly. Napamulagat naman si Nathan.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"So, what's the problem?" Nathan asked him. He shrugged. Sa totoo lang ay hindi niya alam kung anong problema. Problema bang matatawag ang hindi pagmamahal sa kanya ni Hanna?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi yata niya ako mahal." mahinang sabi niya. Nathan made a face.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Why the hell did you come to me, Antonio? I'm a nuero surgeon. Not a psychologist. If you want some advice then you should've gone to Lex. His the psycho one.. I mean the psychologist."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Lex maybe a psychologist but he doesn't know anything about love." malumanay na wika niya. Nathan smiled.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Then ask Caleb. He's the believer."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"He maybe a believer but he's also broken hearted." he sighed. "I need someone sho could understand me. Someone who will listen. And that someone is you. Hindi ko nga alam na dito pala ako nagpunta. I was walking
                                            aimlessly, ni hindi ko alam kung gaano na kalayo. All I knew was I needed to be far away from Hanna, because as long as she's near me, I couldn't avoid the fact that she doesn't love me."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hanna?" kunot noong tanong ni Nathan. "As in Freaky Hanna? Your Freaky Hanna?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Yes..."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You're in love with freaky Hanna?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"We'll she's not as freaky as you imagine her to be. Plus she's such a good person. She's sweet, she has a good heart and those were the reason why I fell in love with her... I guess."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hanna... freaky Hanna..." inulit-ulit ni Nathan ang pangalan ni Hanna. Nagtataka naman akong tumingin sa kanya. He looked as if something had hit him. He looked as if he just realized something.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"What's wrong?" he looked at him with disbelief in his eyes.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You said, you think that Hanna doesn't love you. Hindi mo ba naisip na baka she made you fall for her so she can have her revenge? Poetic justice, kumbaga."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Napalis ang lahat ng sakit na nararamdaman niya sa pagkakataong iyon. He stared at Nathan for a while then he thought about almost all the time and the moments he had spent with Hanna. Her sudden coldness, her rudeness
                                            and the fact that she was trying to hurt him.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Fuck!" bigla siyang napatayo.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"And now you know." Nathan said grinning.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Naghihiganti siya sa akin? Hindi pwede iyon, Bok! naghalikan na kami! Three times!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kerky considred what Nathan told him the other night. His friend was right. There might be a possibility that Hanna wanted to get even with him. He considered all the situations, theire meeting, the way she talked
                                            to him that night -- it was so sweet that he felt at hime with her. The way she acted on their first date. He remembere her comments about his band. Was she trying to provoke him that night? Her reaction when
                                            he kissed her for the first time. Di nga ba at sinabi nito na "I hate you, Kerky?" The thing that she said noong sinagot siya nito. The sudden coldness, tapos iyong pagkalimot nito sa kanilang monthsary, tapos
                                            the thing that happened that day sa office nito aftee declaring his love for her.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">It was all postive. Planado nito ang mga bagay-bagay.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">But why would Hanna do that? Anong kasalanan niya rito? Dahil pa rin ba ito sa nangyari noong prom night nila? But that was years ago! Hindi pa ba iyo nakakalimot? Hindi pa ba ito nakaka-move on sa mga nangyari
                                            noon? She looked better now. She was really beautiful now, pero bakit siya paghihigantihan nito?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">He sighed. Hindi niya maintindihan si Hanna. Kung galit ito sa kanya, bakit hindi na lang siya nito kausapin? Madadaan naman nila ang mga bagay sa matinong usapan. Malaki na sila, pwede na silang umaktong mature.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Antoy!" nag-angat siya ng tingin nang maulinigan niya ang boses ng kanyang kapatid. Nasa grocery sila nang araw na iyon. Sinamahan niya ito dahil naisipan ng kanilang nanay na magluto ng tanghalian para sa lahat.
                                            Matagal-tagal na rin niyang hindi nakakasabay sa kainan ang kanyang pamilya. So when his sister called him, agad naman siyang um-oo dito. Isa pa ay namimiss na niya ang kanyang nanay. Matagal na panahon rin
                                            silang hindi nag-uusap nito. Mula nang magdesisyon siyang itigil ang pagiging arkitekto sa architectural firm ng kanyang ama ay hindi na siya nito masyadong kinikibo. Gusto man niyang ipaliwanag rito ang kanyang
                                            punto ay ayaw naman niyang masaktan ang kanyang nanay. Hindi naman kasi tulad ng normal na pamilya ang pamilya nila. They were the second family. Hindi sila legal. Sa pangit na salita ay kabit ang nanay niya
                                            at sila ng mga kapatid niya ay anak sa labas. The only reason why his father stuck with their family was because of him. Siya lang ang nag-iisang anak na lalaki nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Antoy ano bang problema mo?" tanong ng kanyang Ate Sara. Napalabi pa ito at saka naglagay ng pasta sa pushing cart na dala tulak-tulak niya. "Kanina ka pa tulala. Anong nangyari?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Okay lang ako, Ate." pnilit niyang ngumiti.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Naku, sabihin mo namomoblema ka na naman sa babae." sabad ng kanyang Dite Ara. Kumunot ang noo niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"So, pagtutulungan ninyo ako?" pabirong sabi niya. "Kaya pala pinapunta ninyo ako dito dahil pagtutulungan ninyo ako." sagot niya. Nagtawanan ang kanyang mga kapatid. He smiled. Hearing his sisters laugh made his
                                            day.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Lima silang magkakapatid. Apat na babaeng magkakasunod at siya ang bunso, ang nag-iisang lalaki. Mahal na mahal niya ang kanyang mga kapatid. At alam niyang ganoon rin ang mga ito sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ipapakilala mo na ba kay Nanay ang girlfriend mo?" muling tanong ng Ate Sara niya. Umiling siya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"W-wala naman akong girlfriend." gusto sana niyang sabihin na meron kaya lang hindi naman siya sigurado kung mahal ba siya nito. Noong nakausap niya si Nathan noong isang linggo ay naisip niya kung talaga bang pagmamahal
                                            na ang nararamdaman niya para kay Hanna. In love nga ba siya rito o in love siya sa ideya na maaaring mahal siya nito?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hindi niya alam. Bastga ang alam lang niya ay gusto niya itong palaging nakikita. Hindi siya napapakali kapag hindi niya ito nakaka-usap.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Wala? Ano ka ba naman, Antoy! Ang tanda mo na wala ka pa ring seryosong nakarelasyon. Kailan ka ba mag-aasawa? Gusto ko ng magkapamangkin!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Dite naman, e di ikaw ang mag-asawa!" nanlalaki ang mga matang sabi niya. Nagtawanan ang kanyang mga kapatid. Siya naman ay tahimik na tinitingnan lamang ang mga ito. Napapangiti siya. Dapat yata talaga ay umuwi
                                            na siya ng madalas sa kanila. Kahit paano kasi ay nakakalimot siya kay Hanna at sa mga evil plans nito para sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">He eyed his two sisters. Pagkatapos noon ay naramdaman niya na parang may nakatingin sa kanya. He searched for that person. He was sure that someone was looking at him. Paglingon niya sa katapat na aisle, malapit
                                            sa mga mga prutasan ay nakatayo si Hanna. He was awe struck. Kahit na malayo ito sa kanya ay nararamdaman niya ang tibok ng kanyang puso. Mabilis ito at para bang lalabas sa kanyang lalamunan.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Anong ginagawa ni Hanna dito at bakit siya nakatingin sa kanya?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">------------</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hanna was busy picking fruits for her mother. Bago kasi siya umuwi ay tumawag ito sa kanya at pinadadaan siya sa supermarket dahil gusto nito ng suha. She obliged. Sinabi niyang dadaan siya sa supermarket para dito.
                                            She was so into whatever she was doing nang maulinigan niya ang isang pamliyar na tinig. Agad siyang napalingon nang masiguro niya na iyon nga ang tinig na naririnig niya. And she was right, Kerky was there
                                            pushing a cart, walking after two overweight girls. Ang mas lalo niya ikinagulat ang nang tawagin ni Kerky ang mga ito na Ate at Ditse. That means na magkakapatid ang tatlo. Kulang na lang ay mapanganga siya.
                                            Paano magkakaroon ng ganitong kapatid si Kerky?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">They were overweight and Kerky wasn't making fun at them. Bakit? Akala niya ba ay galit si Kerky sa mga matataba? Bakit nakikipagtawanan pa ito sa mga babaeng iyon?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She knew that it was impolite ti stare pero hindi naman niya mapigilan. She stood there staring at Kerky and the overweight girl nang biglang mapatingin ito sa kanya. Mukhang nagulat rin ito nang makita siya. Anong
                                            gagawin niya? Should she say hi? Pero bakit siya ang babati rito?
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Miss, iyong mansanas mo nalaglag." sabi sa kanya ng isang promodicer na nakatayo pala sa kanyang tabi. She sighed. Kinuha niya ang mansanas at saka muling ibinalik sa rack. She looked at Kerky's direction again
                                            pero hindi na sa kanya nakatingin ang binata. Her eyes widened when she saw Kerky talking to some chinky eyed girl. Mukhang tuwang-tuwa pa si Kerky dahil ang laki ng ngiti nito sa babaeng iyon. Nakadama siya
                                            ng inis. Ang alam niya ay mag-boyfriend pa sila, nagkaroon lang ng di pagkakaunawaan, pero bakit nakikipaglandian na ito sa ibang babae? Sa inis niya ay pinuntahan niya ang kinatatayuan ni Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Mukha naman hindi siya nito napansin. He was too busy talking to that girl that he didn't notice him. Tumungo siya sa likod nito, matapos iyon ay pilit siyang sumiksik sa tabi nito. Mukhang nagulat si Kerky. Awtomatikong
                                            napatingin ito sa kanya, kunot na kunot ang noo at nagtataka. Ipinalupot niya ang braso niya sa braso nito. Tumaas ang kilay nito habang nakatingin sa kanya.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hi, baby." she said trying so hard to sound cool. Hindi kumibo si Kerky. Nanatili lamang itong nakatingin sa kanya. "Aren't you gonna introduce me to her?" tukoy niya sa babaeng kausap nito. Tumikhim ang babaeng
                                            nasa harapan niya. She smiled at her. Hinihintay niya si Kerky na ipakilala siya sa babaeng iyon pero hindi ito nagsasalita. He just stood besiden her like he was thinking of something.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Paano, Kokey, aalis na ako. See you na lang sa office!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Napanganga siya. Ni hindi siya ipinakilala nI Kerky sa babae. Naramdaman niya na dahan-dahang inaalis ni Kerky ang kamay niya sa braso nito. Literal na napanganga siya. Pinanood niya si Kerky. He smiled at the chinky
                                            - eyed girl.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bye, Jenny. See you!" lalo siyang nagulat ng hagkan ni Kerky ang babae sa pisngi. The chinky - girl he called Jenny smiled at him even more. Tumalikod na ito at kumaway kay Kerky. Bumalik si Kerky sa likod ng cart.
                                            Takang-taka siya. Anong nangyayari? Why was Kerky ignoring him?
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"What was that for?" hindi napigilang sabi niya. Hindi siya nito nilingon. Sa halip ay itinulak nito ang cart at saka lumiko sa aisle ng mga delata. Napilitan siyang sumunod. Hindi siya makapapayag na hindi siya
                                            pansinin nito. Ito ang may atraso sa kanya, ito pa ang nan-de-dedma?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi mo ako papansinin? Masama ang loob mo sa akin?" patuloy na litanya niya. Kerky kept on walking.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ano ba!" naiiyak na sigaw niya. Pinagtinginan siya ng mga tao sa paligid! "Pansinin mo naman ako! Nakakainis ka na eh!" halos tumulo ang luha na wika niya. Kerky stopped walking and turned to her.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Now you know how I felt when your were ignoring me." mala-yelong wika nito. Matapos iyon ay tinalikuran siya nito. Literal siyang napanganga. How could Kerky do that to her? Sinundan niya ito. Wala siyang pakialam
                                            kung pinagtitinginan siya ng ibang tao. Ang gusto niya lang ay makipag-usap kay Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Sabi nito sa kanya ay mahal siya nito. But why was he doing this to her.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kerky!" he called him. Huminto namang muli ito. "Why are you doing this to me? I'm your girlfriend!" ipinangalandakan niya sa loob ng grocery store na iyon ang estado ng relasyon nila. Napatingin sa kanya si Kerky.
                                            Kunot na kunot ang noo nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Sabi mo Antoy wala kang girlfriend?" nanlaki ang mga mata niya nang makita niya ang kapatid ni Kerky na nakatayo sa likuran niya. Lumakad ito papunta sa kanyang harap. The lady smiled at her.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"A-antoy?" nagtatakang tanong niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ako si Sara. Ate ako ni Antoy. Ikaw anong pangalan mo?" tanong ng babae.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"H-hanna po.."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Girlfriend ka kamo ni Antoy?" muling tanong nito. Nilingon nito si Kerky. Tapos ay muli siyang tiningnan.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Po.. ano po..."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Nagulat siya ng bigla siya nitong akbayan.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kung girlfriend ka ni Antoy, bakit hindi ka sumama sa amin sa bahay. May kaunting salu-salo doon."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"NO!" giit na tanggi ni Kerky. Ikinakunot iyon ng kanyang noo. What the hell was wrong? Ayaw ba niyang makita siya. Napakagat siya ng labi.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Sige, sasama ako. And yes, I'm his girlfriend, Ate Sara." ngumisi siya kay Kerky. Kerky made a face.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Good. Lika na. Sigurado akong matutuwa si Nanay kapag nakilala ang girlfriend ng bunso namin."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Nagpatiuna na si Ate Sara. Inirapan naman niya si Kerky habang papalapit siya rito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Why are you doing this?" he asked.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I don't know what your talking about." patay malisyang sabi niya. Sumunod siya kay Ate Sara. In her mind, nagsisimula na ang round 3.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Tahimik na nakaupo lamang si Kerky habang tinitingnan niya si Hanna na masayang nakikipag-usap sa Nanay niya. Kasalukuyang nasa kusina ang dalawa habang siya naman ay nakaupo sa mahabang silya na nakatapat lamang
                                            sa kusina. He had never seen his mother smile like that to a woman she barely know. Si Hanna ang unang babaeng inuwi niya sa kanila at hindi niya inaasahan na ganoon ang magiging reaksyon ng mga kapatid niya
                                            lalo na ng kanyang Nanay. Matagal-tagal na rin siyang hindi nakakauwi sa kanila. Mula nang sabihin niya sa Nanay niya na hindi na siya magta-trabaho sa kompanya ng tatay niya ay madalang na siyang umuwi. Alam
                                            kasi niyang nagtatampo ang nanay niya sa kanya. His mother didn't want him to leave the company because it was the only way he could ever be close to his father. Pero hindi naman mahalaga iyon sa kanya. Mula
                                            nang malaman niyang sila ang ikalawang pamilya ay hindi na siya umasa na mabubuo ang kanilang pamilya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bakit tahimik ka?" untag ng Ate Sara niya. Umupo ito sa tabi niya. Napansin niyang may hawak itong kutsilyo at sangkalan. Napailing siya. "Mukang gusto ni Nanay ang Hanna mo."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Ngiti lamang ang isinagot niya sa kanyang kapatid. He couldn't help thinking about what Nathan said to him the other night after they had a talk. After going to Nathan, he went to Lex and told him everything that
                                            Nathan have said at tulad ni Nathan ay ganoon din ang sinabi ni Lex. Hindi siya makapaniwala sa nangyari. Hanna trying to get even at him? For what? For that stupid prom night act he pulled? Matagal na iyon.
                                            Ang ibig bang sabihin ay hindi nito nakalimutan ang bagay na iyon?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ate, paano mo nalaman na mahal mo na pala si Kuya Alfon?" tanong niya sa kanyang kapatid. Ang tinutukoy niya ay ang asawa nito. Napangiti ang kanyang ate at saka tumingin sa kanya. Tumayo muna ito at hinatak ang
                                            isang basket ng mangga. Muling naupo ang kanyang kapatid at nagsimulang balatan ang mga mangga.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ate..." kinalabit niya ito. Binigyan siya nito ng kutsilyo. "You want me to kill myself?"</p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ano ka ba, Antoy! Magbalat ka ng mangga!" pinanlakihan pa siya ng mata nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Sagutin mo iyong tanong ko." ungot niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Antoy, hindi ko alam ang sagot sa tanong mo. All I know is I am very much in love with my husband. I didn't know how I realized the fact that I love him. Basta alam ko lang." nginitian siyang muli nito. "Bakit
                                            mo tinatanong?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Because... we'll" he swallowed. "I don't know if I'm in love with Hanna." he sighed. "I thought I was in love with her, but now I don't know anymore. Nathan and Lex... they said that..."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Nathan and Lex?" tumaas ang kilay ng kanyang kapatid. "Bakit napasama si Nathan at Lex sa usapan?</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"They are my friends and ---"</p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"If you want to know what you really feel about Hanna, you have got to stop listening to other people. Hindi naman si Lex at si Nathan ang palaging kasama ni Hanna, ikaw."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Do you think Hanna loves me, Ate Sara?" hindi nakatiis na tanong niya. Her sister looked at Hanna. She was still talking to their mother. His sister smiled and said;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Yes. I do think she loves you."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kahit ayaw niya ay napangiti siya. Muli niyang tiningnan si Hanna. By that time ay nakasunod ito sa Nanay niya habang may dalang malaking plato.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kainan na!" nakatawang wika nito. Inilapag nito ang plato na may lamang paella -- ang especialty ng Nanay niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hanna helped me cooked, Antoy. I like her." sabi ng kanyang Nanay. Saglit na natigilan si Hanna habang nakatingin sa nanay niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"T-thank you po, Tita..."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Anong Tita? Nanay na ang itawag mo sa akin." binalingan siya ng kanyang Nanay. "If you don't marry her, Antonio, I swear to god, ihahanap ko siya ng ibang makakatuluyan. She's a keeper."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Nay!" nakadama siya ng hiya. Hindi ba naisip ng nanay niya na nakakahiya kay Hanna? Baka isipin nito ay ipinagduduldulan niya ang sarili nito sa kanya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kumain na nga tayo at pulang-pula na ang mukha ni Antoy." natatawang wika ng kanyang Ate Sara. Tinawag nito ang iba pa niyang mga kapatid. Maya-maya lamang ay halos sabay-sabay na nilang pinagsasaluhan ang tanghaliang
                                            niluto ng nanay niya.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hanna seems to be enjoying herself. Kahit paano ay napapangiti siya. He sighed. If ever Nathan and Lex were right, he would be really broken hearted. So he silently prayed that Hanna was being true to him and that
                                            she wasn't here just for revenge.</p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kailangan ko na pong umuwi."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Magalang na nagpaalam si Hanna sa mga kapatid at Nanay ni Kerky. Nalibang kasi siya sa pagkikipagkwentuhan sa mga ito. She never realized that someone as boastful and mean as Kerky would come from a very humble
                                            family.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kanina nga, habang kausap niya ang mga kapatid nito ay naisip niyang baka ampon si Kerky. Ang babait kasi ng mga kapatid nito lalo na si Ate Sara at Dite Anna. Nalaman niya na si Kerky pala ang bunso sa limang magkakapatid
                                            at ito rin ang nag-iisang lalaki. Nalaman niya rin na isa palang licensed architect si Kerky at ito ang nagdisenyo ng bahay na kinatatayuan niya ngayon. She realized na sa paningin ng mga kapatid nito ay isang
                                            napakabait na tao ni Kerky -- pero parang mali naman sila doon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hinding-hindi niya pa rin talaga makakalimutan ang ginawa nito sa kanya noon. Kaya nga nandito siya. She's here to look for something that she can use against him. A deep secret. Something that will break him apart.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Uuwi? Pero gabi na. Bakit hindi ka na lang dito matulog?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Nay!" narinig niyang sigaw ni Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bakit? Alas diyes na ng gabi. Huwag mong sabihing ihahatid mo si Hanna sa Maynila tapos ay babalik ka dito?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Nay, Cavite lang naman ito. Ilang oras lang iyon. Kaya ko siyang ihatid." Kerky insisted. Umiling ang nanay nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ay naku, Antoy!" bumaling ito sa kanya. "Dito ka na lang matulog at bukas ng umaga ay ihahatid ka ni Antoy pabalik sa siyudad, ayos ba iyon?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Napakagat-labi siya. Dito siya matutulog? She looked at Kerky who was now signaling her to shake her head and said no. She grinned at him. Anong akala nito? Susundin niya ito? She smiled at looked at Kerky's mother.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"O-okay lang po, Nay. I guess, I'll just text my parents."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Good." wika ng nanay ni Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"What?!" tila nabibiglang sigaw ni Kerky. Napailing na lang siya. Agad na inilabas niya ang kanyang cellphone at iti-next ang mga magulang niya. Niyakag siya ng Dite Anna ni Kerky.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Halika, Hanna. Pahihiramin kita ng damit. Iyong mga damit ko noong sexy pa ako." napahagikgik siya sa tinuran ng kapatid ni Kerky. Masayahin ang mga kapatid nito. Nakilala niya halos lahat. Ang Sansi Roann ni Kerky
                                            ay isang chef, tulad ni Dite Anna ay chubby din ito, ang pangalawa sa bunso naman nila Kerky, si Ditse Belle ay nurse sa isang ospital doon, sa apat na magkakapatid na babae ay si Ditse Belle lang ang medyo
                                            payat.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">They went upstairs to Ditse Anna's bedroom. Pumasok siya at napangiti nang makita niya ang ayos ng kwarto nito. Very environmental friendly ang bahay nila Kerky. Malalaki ang bintana at halos lahat ng gamit ay gawa
                                            sa kawayan. Parang modern version ng isang bahay kubo ang bahay nila. What really caught her attention was the big old narra tree standing mightily in the middle of the living room.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ang ganda ng bahay ninyo, Dite." nakangiting sabi niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ay, oo!" humarap ito sa kanya. "Ito iyong regalo ni Antoy kay Nanay dalawang taon matapos niyang maka-graduate." May kinuha ito sa kabinet. Pagkatapos ay ibinigay nito iyon sa kanya. Isang duster na kulay pink
                                            ang ibinigay nito sa kanya. Napangiwi siya. Hindi naman siya nagsusuot ng duster pero dahil underwear lang ang baon niya ay mapipilitan siyang isuot iyon.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Thanks... Saan iyong bathroom ninyo?" itinuro nito ang direksyon. Nagpunta siya doon at saka naglinis ng katawan. Iniisip niya kung anong tumaktabo sa isip ni Kerky. Was he okay with this? Hindi talaga niya ala,
                                            but she felt like something had change with the way Kerky looked at her. Parang may alam ito na hindi nito dapat malaman na hindi naman sinasabi nito sa kanya. Nang matapos siyang maglinis ay lumabas siya. Naglalakad
                                            siya paakyat sa taas nang mapansin niya ang bulto ni Kerky na lumabas ng bahay. Sinundan niya ito.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kerky was wondering off that big piece of land his mother owns. Hindi nito alam na sinusundan niya ito. Nakita niyang naupo ito sa ilalim ng malaking puno ng mangga. Noon lamang niya napansin na may dala itong gitara.
                                            She tiptoed... dahan-dahan niyang tinahak ang direksyon nito. Nang nakatayo na siya sa likod nito ay saka niya ito ginulat.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bulaga!" humagikgik siya. Kerky looked at her as if he had just seen a ghost.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Jeez! I could've died!"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Umupo siya sa tabi nito.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Bakit hindi ka pa natutulog, Antoy?" she laughed when Kerky made a face.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Jeez... stop calling me that."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Iyon ang tawag nila sa'yo." nakangusong sabi niya.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"We'll they're my family and I grew up with them so..."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Napahagikgik na naman siya. She didn't know what occured to her but she took Kerky's hand and urged him to pull her closer. He did. They were now under the mango tree, Kerky's arms around her waist and her head
                                            was leaning on his shoulder.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You didn't text me or called me after that drama you made in the office." she said. Huminga ng malalim si Kerky. Hinawakan nito ang kanyang kamay.</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I figured you didn't wanna see me."</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Why did you think that?" she asked again.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Because you don't love me..." halos bulong na iyon nang lumabas sa bibig nito. She looked up at him. He thinks that she doesn't love him? How come? Ibig sabihin ay nararamdaman nito ang sakit na nais niyang maramdaman
                                            nito. Nakadama siya ng guilt. She could see pain in his eyes. Alam niyang dapat ay matuwa siya sapagkat nasasaktan niya si Kerky, it was all a apart of her plan but the, why was she feeling like this?
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"That's----"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hey do you remember prom night?"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Natigilan siya. Tinitigan niya si Kerky. He was smiling at her.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"W-why?"</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Wala lang. Bigla ko kasing naisip iyong nangyari that night. You know, when I pulled a trick on you."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hindi niya napigilan ang pagtiim ng kanyang bagang. Muli na namang bumalik ang galit niya kay Kerky. She was gritting her teeth. Pilit niyang kinakalma ang sarili. She hated the fact that he could be so happy upon
                                            remembering that night. Lumayo siya rito.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You remembered?" she asked sardonically.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Why? Did you ever forgot, Hanna?" muli na naman siyang natigilan. Something was wrong with the way Kerky spoke those words. Tila may laman ang mga iyon.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Wait, why are we talking about this again?" she asked trying to divert the topic. Kerky grinned. That grin took her breath away.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I knew, somehow, Hanna, you never forgot that night." may tila lungkot sa mga mata nito. "And somehow, in my hearts of hearts, I wanted to help you forget that." huminga pa ito ng malalim at saka hinawakan ang
                                            kanyang kamay.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ano bang sinasabi mo?" tumahip ang kanyang dibdib. Kerky shook his head.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"No more pretensions, Hanna. I know."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Her eyes widened. He knows? What?
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You want revenge. I'm giving it to you." Kerky finally said. Napanganga siya. How the hell did he knew about that?
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You want revenge. I'm giving it to you."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Napatayo si Hanna. Agad na lumayo si kay Kerky. Hindi siya makapaniwala. How did he knew about that? Ganoon ba talaga siya ka-obvious? Hindi pa siya nakakaganti ay alam na nito ang kanyang ginagawa. She slapped
                                            him hard.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Sa tingin mo ganoon kadali iyon?!" sigaw niya dito. "Ano ako, bata na aabutan mo ng candy? I've worked hard on this! I wanted you to fell the pain you have caused me! Tapos sasabihin mo that you're just ginna hand
                                            it to me! Fuck you!"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Naramdaman niya ang pag-iinit ng kanyang mga mata. Hindi siya iiyak sa harap nito. Hindi niya ipapakita dito ang kahinaan niya.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"It was my fault. I knew what I have done and all I want was to give you what you want so you could have your peace of mind." kalmadong wika nito. Umiling siya. Wala pa sa hinagap ni Kerky ang naiisip nitong kasalanan
                                            nito sa kanya. Wala itong ideya kung anong mga bagay ang dapat niyang pagdaanan marating niya lang ang kinatatayuan niya ngayon. He didn't know what pain she had to go through para lang makaganti siya dito tapos
                                            sasabihin nito iyon? Ano ito, lokohan?
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You didn't know what I had to go through, so stop!" tumalikod siya. Hindi niya alam kung hahakbang ba siya palayo o babalikan niya si Kerky. Anong mangyayari ngayon? All her plans were ruined. The thing that she
                                            wanted to do the most -- hurt Kerky and leave him hanging couldn't be done because of this.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hanna," tawag nito sa kanya. Hinarap niya ito.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Did you know that I hated myself for a long time because of what you did!" sigaw niya dito. Muli na namang nanumbalik sa kanya ang sakit na naramdaman niya noong gabing iyon. "I was so in love with you, Kerky.
                                            Kulang na lang ay halikan ko ang lupang tinatapakan mo. Nagha-hyperventilate ko sa tuwing lalapit ka sa akin at kakausapin mo ako. Nagpapakatanga ako para sa'yo, nagpapauto. Ginagawa ko ang projects mo, kahit
                                            na ako iyong walang maipasa mapansin mo lang ako!"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I'm sorry for that..." mahinang pahayag ng binata sa kanyang harapan. Umiling siya. Sorry? She suffered for years and all she could get was a simple sorry? That was not even enough to supress the pain she has inside.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"That night... all I wanted was a dance with you so I could leave the school with peace in my heart and yet, you humiliated me." hindi na niya napigil ang mga luhang kanina pa nagbabadayang tumulo. She couldn't
                                            help it anymore. She could feel the pain stinging her heart like it was a virus. Ang sakit. Hindi niya alam na ganoon pa rin kalaki ang sugat na iniwan ni Kerky sa kanya.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Free yourself from the pain." Lumapit si Kerky sa kanya. She stepped back.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Free myself? How could I do that if I could see you happy?" napailing siya. "The only way for me to be happy is if I see you suffering from so much pain! Doon lang ako magiging masaya!"
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Then hurt me! Sa tingin mo ba hindi ako nasasaktan? I found out that the woman I was supposed to be in love with only wanted me for revenge! Hindi ba masakit iyon?"

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Sorry doesn't take all the pain away Kerky." tuluyan na niyang tinalikuran ang binata. She ran inside the house and went straight upstairs. Sinubukan niyang kalmahin ang kanyang sarili. It was a good thing Kerky's
                                            sisters were already asleep. She went to bed and there she lie down and let the tears fall freely.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Bakit ganoon? All she wanted was to get even. She waited for years for this moment to happen. She waited for a long time para makaharap niyang muli ang lalaking nanakit sa kanya ngunit bakit kung kailan sa tingin
                                            niya ay malapit na niyang makuha ang inaasam ay saka pa ito nangyari? She only wanted justice for herself and yet everything failed just because of that man.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Masama ba siyang tao for wanting that? Gusto lang naman niyang maging malaya at sa tingin niya talaga ay magiging malaya lamang siya sa oras na makita niyang si Kerky naman ang nahihirapan.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Ang hirap tanggapin na sa isang iglap lahat ng plano niya ay bigla na lang nawala. He already knew that she was only here for revenge. Ano pang sinabi nito? He was giving it to her. Ano iyon? Lokohan? Ano bang akala
                                            ni Kerky, candy ang hinihingi niya? She suffered for years because of him. She was depressed. She had trust issues. Nawala ang self confidence niya dahil dito tapos sasabihin nito ang mga katagang iyon na parang
                                            kay dali-dali?
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Unfair!</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She turned and embraced the huge pillow beside her. Why was it so hard getting over that jerk? She's not even in love with him and yet he's already breaking her heart.
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Sinulyapan ni Kerky si Hanna habang nagpapaalam ito sa kanyang ina. He was observing her. Her eyes were a bit sore. Sigurado siya na umiyak ito kagabi matapos ang usapan nila. Alam niyang nasaktan niya ito. Alam
                                            niyang hindi nito nagustuhan ang katotohanan na alam na niya ang balak nito.

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Antoy, ingat sa pagmamaneho..." paalala ng nanay niya. He just nodded. Lumapit siya rito at saka niyakap ito. Bago siya humiwalay ay binulungan pa siya nito. "I like her, Antonio."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Si Nanay talaga." kunwa'y natatawa siya. Binalingan niya si Hanna. She seemed so far. He wanted to hug her and tell her how sorry he was but he knew that she wouldn't listen if he talks to her now. Inaya niya itong
                                            sumakay na sa kotse. Nagpatiuna naman ito. She didn't even gave him the chance to open the door for her.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">A little while later, they were on the highway, Hanna was still very quiet and it was killing him.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hanna please talk to me." halos bulong na ang mga katagang iyon nang lumabas sa kanyang bibig. Hanna glared at him.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"This would be the last time we'll ever see each other."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"It doesn't have to end like this." muling pahayag niya. "I told you, I'm willing to do anything just to make you feel better."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ten years, Kerky and you're only saying that to me now?"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Iyon nga eh. Ten years but you didn't forget! You were living in the past and now that I want to straight it out, ikaw naman ang tumatanggi!"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hanna looked at him. He could see pain in her eyes and just like that he wanted to kill himsef. He silently cursed himself.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I'm sorry, Hanna... I didn't mean too.."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hanna didn't said anything. She again looked away. The rest of the trip was very quiet. Damang-dama niya ang bigat ng loob ni Hanna. He sighed. Kung pwede lang sana niyang ipaliwanag ang dahilan kung bakit niya
                                            nagawa ang bagay na iyon siguro ay maiintindihan siya nito. Ang problema kasi ay nabulag na si Hanna ng galit nito sa kanya. He was sure that even though he tried talking to her ay hindi naman ito makikinig.
                                            They would just end up fighting each other and he didn't want that. Right now ay isa lang naman ang gusto niya, ang makitang nakangiti si Hanna. Nais niyang mawala ang sakit na alam niyang siya ang may dulot.
                                            Kung hahayaan lang sana niya nitong magsalita at magpaliwanag, marahil ay matagal na silang nagkaintindihan...
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Galit siya sa kanyang sarili dahil sa nangyayari sa kanila ngayon. Tama naman si Hanna. It was all his fault. If he didn't do that prank, if he didn't say those words then maybe wala sila sa sitwasyong ito. But
                                            if he didn't the things he did back then, malamang siya naman ang wala sa lugar na ito. May malalim siyang dahilan kung bakit niya nagawa ang bagay na iyon. He knew that if ever Hanna decides to hear him ay
                                            maiintidihan siya nito kaya lang kailan iyon? Mukhang hindi naman makikinig sa kanya ang dalaga. At nasasaktan siya dahil doon.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">The last time he checked, he was in love with Hanna but now, he was confused. How could he love somebody like Hanna? A woman who wanted him only for revenge. Malas yata talaga siya sa pag-ibig. He always fell in
                                            love with the wrong ones. First it was with Hope, he fell in love with her and yet he didn't had the courage to show her how he really feels, tapos dumating si Ian, wrong timing naman ang nangyari sa kanila.
                                            He finally had the courage to tell her how he feels but then Robi came knocking on his door asking him to leave Ian alone. Ngayon naman ay si Hanna. Muli ay tinapunan niya ito ng tingin. Ano bang dapat niyang
                                            gawin para mapatawad siya nito?
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Huminga siya ng malalim. Finally he reached Hanna's house. Walang pag-aatubili na bumaba si Hanna sa sasakyan at dali-daling iniwan siya. Hinabol niya ito.
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hinarap siya nito.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Matapos sabihin iyon ay pumasok na ito sa loob ng malaking gate na iyon at saka isinara. He walked closer, he knocked.

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kerky sat on one of the chairs inside the witing room of Revert Records. He was looking at the ceiling trying to figure out the things that he should do. Alam niyang mya mga bagay siyang dapat gawin ngunit hindi
                                            niya ginagawa. He knew that he had to come and find Hanna -- we'l he knew ehre to fid nher, he was just scared to face her. Hindi pa rin kasi niya makalimutan ang sakit na nakit niya sa mga mata nito noong gabing
                                            huli silang nag-usap. He saw the streak of pain in her eyes and everytime he remembers that, he felt like punching himself.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">He was a jerk -- we'll back in high school he was. Things have changed. Hindi na siya ang Kerky noon. He knew what hanna thinks of him at alam naman niyang tma ang tingin nito sa kanya kaya lang nakakaramdam pa
                                            rin siya ng lungkot sapagkat ayaw siyang pakinggan nito. If only Hanna would stop and listen to him, maybe they could turn the things around.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kerky?" isang tinig ang narinig niya. Nag-angat agad siya ng tingin and he saw Ian approaching him. He smiled. Hindi na tulad noon ang nararamdaman niya dito. Noon kasi sa tuwing titingnan niya si Ian at ngingiti
                                            ito sa kanya ay nakakaramdam siya ng sakit sa tuwing maiisip niya na hindi pwedeng maging sa kanya si Ian, but seeing Ian now, he felt nothing but true happiness for her.

                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">He shrugged at her. He wanted to be alone, pero imposibleng mangyari iyon dahil magulo sina Lex at Calen. Buti kung si Caleb lang ang kasama niya, makakapg-isip siya.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Oh my, you're under a spell." nakangiting wika ni Ian. Nagtatakang nilingon naman niya ito.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"What spell?" he asked.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"A love spell." she said laughing. "The guys, I mean the Neon boys had it bad, now all of them are taken."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Yeah, even Robi..." he commented. Ian's eyes twinkled and immediately he knew that Ian had finally got the happy ending she deserves.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"So are you in love?" again, Ian asked him. The smile on his face froze. Is he in love? Is he in love with Hanna? Hindi na niya alam. He liked Hanna before he found out that she wanted to get even with him. He liked
                                            Hanna. He loved the thought of her and him together, holding hands, feeling very happy, but that was before pero ngayon ay hindi na niya alam.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"How do you know if you're in love?" He looked at her. Ian just smiled.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You can never explain how it worls, Kerky. You'll just know." nagbuntong hininga si Ian at saka tinapik ang kanyang binti, she then stood up and left him there. Bigla ay napaisip siya. Bakit lahat ng tao na tinatanong
                                            niya ay ganoon ang sagot sa kanya? You'll just know. Paano malalaman iyon? He thought he was in love with Hanna, but now he wasn't sure at all. Paano niya malalaman kung anong nararamdaman niya para dito? All
                                            he knew was how much he wanted Hanna to listen to him.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">He sighed, if only Hanna would hear him out...
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">---------------</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Some years ago...
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Prom night na, may date na kayo?"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kerky looked at his friends who was busy doing their own things. The twins - Calen and Caleb were sitting beside each other, Caleb was looking at Calen's math test, he was also shaking his head. Caleb seemed disappointed
                                            while Lex was playing with his pencil while looking away. Sinundan niya ang tingin ng kaibigan at tulad ng hinala niya ay nakatingin na naman ito kay Barbara. He smirked.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Jeez, why don't you ask her out already? Barbara likes you too, Lex." komento niya. Lex looked at him.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi pa pwede, sophomore pa lang siya. Hindi pa pwedeng ligawan."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"So how about prom night, guys? Are you coming?" pag-iba niya ng usapan.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Why are you so excited about the prom night?" Nathan asked him. Nathan was sitting beside him.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kasi may date na ako. Ikaw Nathan, pupunta ka?"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Keith hates proms so, I really don't know..." mahinang wika nito. Kumunot ang noo niya. Magrereklamo na sana siya nang biglang sumabat si Lex.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Just because Keith does not like prom night, hindi ka na pupunta? Ano iyon?"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Just shut up, Lex!"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hoy!" he hissed. "It's bad enough Lex and Keith always fight, pati ba naman kayo?" napakamot siya ng ulo. Ano bang problema ng mga kaibigan niya? Mukhang hindi interesado ang mga ito sa prom night na gaganapin
                                            sa isang araw. Siya naman ay tuwag-tuwa, he already invited Sandy -- his girlfriend to the prom and she already said yes. Excited na siya, nakaayos na rin ang susuotin niya. Wala na siyang problema. Maghihintay
                                            na lang siya ng araw.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kerky, si Freaky Hanna oh!" siniko siya ni Lex. Agad niyang nilingon ang itinurong direksyon ng kaibigan. He saw Freaky Hanna -- iyong classmate niyang alam niyang patay na patay sa kanya na nakatayo malapit sa
                                            malaking puno ng mangga at nakatingin sa kanya. He almost smirked but he didn't let her see that. He raised his hand and waved at him. Freaky Hanna waved back and then she left. Pa-sway-sway pa ang lakad nito.
                                            Napailing siya.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Si Hanna ba ang date mo sa prom?" nakangising tanong ni Calen.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Huuu! Hindi noh! Over my dead sexy body!"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">He met Hanna when he was in second year high school. Kaklase niya ito. Noong una ay hindi naman niya ito pinapansin but then one day, his classmate told him na may crush daw ito sa kanya. Simula noon ay nailang
                                            na siya rito. Kaya pala madalas niyang mahuling nakatingin ito sa kanya, pinagnanasaan pala siya nito. Hindi naman niya kasi gusto si Hanna. Unang-una si Sandy talaga ang gusto niya. Pangalawa, hindi niya magugustuhan
                                            si Hanna dahil hindi naman ito maganda. Hanna's fat. She's too fat for him. Sinabi niya talaga na hindi niya ito magugustuhan.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Pero isang araw, biglang may ideyang pumasok sa isipan niya. Magagamit niya ang pagkagusto ni Hanna sa kanya para utuin itong gawin ang projects at assignments niya. Yes he was that evil and he's proud of it. Mula
                                            nang araw na iyon ay hindi na siya nawawalan ng assignments. Isang ngiti at kindat niya lang kay Hanna ay natutunaw na agad ang puso nito.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ulol ka, Kerky." napatingin siya kay Caleb.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ano na naman ang ginawa ko?"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Alam mo bang pinagalitan siya ni Mr. De Dios kahapon sa faculty dahil hindi siya nakapagpasa ng project sa Science."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Palagay ko kaya hindi nagpasa iyon kasi ginawa muna iyong sa'yo." komento pa ni Lex. Ipinagkibit balikat na lamang niya iyon. Wala siyang pakialam kahit na anong mangyari dito basta ang mahalaga ay naipasa nito
                                            ang project niya. Nagpasalamat naman siya dito kahapon, hindi na,an siya ganoon kasama na dararting sa punto na babalewalain niya ang mga bagay na ginagawa nito para sa kanya. He still have a heart.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Naku, bahala nga kayo diyan, pupuntahan ko muna si Sandy."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Tinalikuran niya ang mga kaibigan. Tinungo niya ang daan patungo sa basket ball court kung saan matatagpuan niya si Sandy. Excited siyang makita ito. Natutuwa talaga siya dahil pumayag itong makipag-date sa kanya.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kerky!" agad itong ngumiti nang makita siya. Nilapitan siya nito at saka hinatak.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Na-miss mo ako?" malambing na tanong niya. Ang ganda talaga ng Sandy niya. Suot nito ang cheer leading uniform nito. She looked so cute wearing that.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>

                                        </p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hi, Kerky..." sabay - sabay na bati ng mga ito.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hello, anong meron?" nagtatakang tanong niya. Lumapit sa kanya ang isang kaibigan ni Sandy. Nakangiti ito sa kanya habang may inaabot na picture. Kinuha niya iyon at ganoon na lamang ang panlalaki ng kanyang mga
                                            mata nang makita niya kung anong nasa litrato. It was his pictures.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"W-who took this?" hindi makapaniwalang sabi niya. Hinablot sa kanya iyon ni Sandy.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Does it matter?" tanong nito. "Ikaw iyan diba, Kerky? You took out Mr. Ramirez's exam para malaman kung anong mga tanong doon. Kaya nga mataas ang scores mo sa Math and Science, it because you cheated."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"What?" nagtatakang tumingin siya kay Sandy. "Why are you doing this to me? You're my girlfriend!"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I am... and I love you but what you did is wrong..."

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Are you gonna tell on me?" He asked feeling so nervous. If Sandy tell their teachers about what he did, alam niyang ma-e-expell siya sa school His mother would be disappointed of him again. Mag-aaway na naman ito
                                            at ang kanyang Papa. At alam niyang kapag nalaman ito ng kanyang Papa ay magagalit rin ito sa kanya. Sasabihin na naman nito na kahihiyan siya sa pamilya.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Ayaw niyang ma-disappoint ang kanyang Nanay at ayaw rin niya magalit sa kanya ang kanyang Papa. Hindi nila pwedeng malaman ang ginawa niya.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"But, don't worry, hindi naman namin sasabihin ito, Kerky..."

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"H-hindi?" he asked feeling a bit happy.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"If you give in to our conditions..."

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kumunot ang kanyang noo. Anong kondisyon?
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Anong kondisyon?" he asked feeling bad.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You know Freaky Hanna right..."
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">He hated himself after that night. Alam niyang hindi niya dapat ginawa ang bagay na iyon. He saw how embarassed Hanna was. Hinding-hindi niya makakalimutan ang gabing iyon. He lterally crushed Hanna's dream kung
                                            kaya't hindi niya ito masisisi kung galit na galit ito sa kanya ngayon.

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Halos sampung taon na ang nakaraan pero dala-dala ni Hanna sa puso nito ang galit nito pa sa kanya. Alam niyang hindi tamang rason niya noon, alam niyang mali pero ginawa pa rin niya. He saved himslef by pushing
                                            Hanna off the boat. Ang tagal niyang hindi nakatulog dahil sa tuwing pipikit siya ay nakikita niya ang histura nito. Pero hindi naman niya alam na ganoon kalaki ang epekto ng ginawa niya kay Hanna. He wanted
                                            to back out that night but he wa so scared that the cheer leaders might tell everyone about what he did so he just went with the flow.

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">He knew what kind of an asshole he was on Hanna's eyes and he wanted to change that. He wanted her to see that he was now a changed man. He wanted to give her what she wants but how?
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Nag-angat ng tingin si Hanna nang marinig niya ang boses ni Menchie. She smiled at her and then she shook her head. Napakamot naman ng ulo ang kanyang kaibigan.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi naman ako nagyosi ngayon." nakangusong sabi niya.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi ka PA nagyoyosi ngayon. Akala ko ba nag-quit ka na?"

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She thought so too. Iyon pala hindi pa. Nagsimula na naman ang bisyo niya mula nang huli silang mag-usap ni Kerky. Lalo siyang namuli rito. Anong akala nito, ganoon kadali ang paghihiganting gusto niya at ibibigay
                                            na lang nito ang bagay na iyon na parang candy? Hindi naman siya nakikipaglokohan dito. Ang akala siguro nito ay batang munti siya na maaari nitong utuin. Hindi na siya bata at mas lalong hindi na siya uto-uto.
                                            Hindi siya papayag na ganoon na lang basta ang mangyayari.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Mas mabuti pang mag-coffee ka na lang kaysa maging yosi adik ka na naman." komento pa nito. Umiling siya.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Okay lang ako." she lied. Hindi siya okay. Gusto niyang sumigaw. Gusto niyang magwala. Ano bang meron si Kerky at hanggang ngayon ay nasasaktan siya nito? She saw how great his family were, she have met his sisters
                                            at hindi niya maintindihan ay kung bakit ganoon ito sa kanya dati? Mataba ang mga kapatid nito, pero bakit ganoon na lang ang muhi nito sa kanya noon? Binuksan niya ang drawer niya at kinuha doon ang isang kaha
                                            ng sigarilyo. Everytime she thinks of Kerky, she felt like having a puff. Tumayo siya at lumabas sa cubicle niya. Nakita niyang umiling si Menchie. Hindi na lang niya ito pinansin. Lumabas siya at nagpunta sa
                                            smoker's area. She lit her cigarrette and she puffed away.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Ang sama ng loob niya. Bakit ba ganito na lang ang epekto sa kanya ni Kerky? Kung tutuusin ay parang alam niya ang sagot pero hindi naman kayang tanggapin ng kalooban niya. It's been years and she has cjanged kaya
                                            hindi niya kayang tanggapin na hindi nakasama sa pagbabago niya ang nararamdaman niya para dito. Hindi niya mahal si Kerky. Nalilito lang siya sa galit at pagkamuhi na nararamdaman niya dito. She doesn't love
                                            him. Hindi naman ibig sabihin na nasasaktan siya ay mahal niya pa rin itp. Nasasaktan lang siya dahil hindi natupad ang mga plano niya sa buhay.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Naubos ang isang stick. Itinapon niya iyon kung saan. She shook her head and decided to go back upstairs para magtrabaho na lang ulit. She needed to take Kerky off her mind. Ayaw na ayaw niyang naiisip ito. Pumihit
                                            siya paharap, bigla ay natigilan siya. Her mouth slightly fell open when she saw Kerky standing near the smorker's area sign looking at her intently.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I didn't know that you smoke." komento nito. She smirked at him,
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Marami kang hindi alam. Anong ginagawa mo dito?" iritableng pahayag niya. Kerky moved closer. "Stay there and don't come near me." hindi na niya itatago ang galit niya dito. Kerky stopped after hearing that.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I owe you an apology and you owe me a moment." diretsong sabi nito.

                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Nanggagalaiti na siya sa galit. Gusto na niyang magwala but then she didn't want to make a scene. Instead of yelling at Kerky, she again took out another stick of cigarrette, lit it and puffed it out. Kitang-kita
                                            niya ang pagkalukot ng mukha ni Kerky. Mabilis na kinuha nito ang sigarilyo sa kanya at itinapon iyon kung saan.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I hate kissing a smoker." lukot na lukot ang mukha na pahayag nito. She looked at him.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I am not asking you to like kissing me!" she yelled. "Isa pa, sino bang nagsabi sa'yong gusto ko ang mga halik mo? I was just doing that to make you fall in love with me. My plan was working so well but trhen you
                                            had to found out and everything was screwed and ---"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kerky made her stop talking by pulling her closer and kissing her on the lips. Nanlalaki ang mga mata niya. Hindi niya inaasahan na hahalikan siya ni Kerky sa ganoong sitwasyon. Nabitiwan niya ang hawak niyang kaha
                                            ng sigarilyo. Naramdaman rin niya ang panginginig ng kanyang mga tuhod. She needed support that was the reason why she out her arms around his neck but what she couldn't explain was the fact that he was also
                                            pulling Kerky closer. She felt scared that he might end the amazing kiss he was giving her.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">His kiss was truly amazing. Every brush, every stroke of his lips managed to bring a tingling sensation in every bones and veins of her body. She felt different. She felt the hunger in Kerky's kiss. She felt wanted,
                                            she felt beautiful. Funny because she was feeling those things right now and the person making her feel that was her most hated person. her most hated person was making her feel like she was loved and treasured.
                                            Her most heated person was making her feel like she was the most important person ion Earth and the fact that she ,iked it made it even more harder for her to understand the things that was happening between
                                            them.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Why was she letting him kiss her that way?
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Isang dahilan lang ang alam niya. Ang dahilan na ayaw tanggapin ng buong pagkatao niya.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">She's in love with Kerky...
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hanna was so shaken with her realization. She couldn't believe the fact that she was still in love with Kerky. Kerky, the person who broke her heart into tiny million pieces, Kerky the person who made her hate herself
                                            for a long time. Bakit hindi nawala ang pagmamahal niya dito? She was supposed to be mad at him, she was supposed to get even but what happened to her?
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Wala siyang nagawa sa nararamdaman niya para dito. Ni hindi siya makakilos. So when Kerky drag her by the hand, took her to his car and drove away, wala na rin siyang kibo. Hindi niya alam kung saan siya dadalhin
                                            nito, walang malinaw na bagay para sa kanya ngayon.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">They drove for an hour and when he finally stopped, she had the guts to finally look at him in the eyes and speak.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Where are we?" mahina ang tinig na wika niya. Kerky looked at her.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"In the middle of nowhere." he answered with the same tone as her. They both sighed.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I'm sorry, Hanna." muling wika ni Kerky. She looked away. Ayaw niyang ipakita dito na nanghihina siya, ayaw niyang makita nito na unti-unting natutunaw ang mga barriers na itinayo niya sa paligid niya. She didn't
                                            want him to see the love she feels for hin in her eyes. She didn't want to raise the white flag yet.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You're an asshole." balik niya rito.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I was, I still am. But I'm truly very sorry for what I did, Hanna. I knew that I should've never done that. It didn't made me any superior to others. Nasaktan ka, kinamuhian mo ako. But that was years ago, we both
                                            need to move on."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Move on? Move on?" hinarap niya ito. "Paano ako makaka-move on kung hindi ko nakikita na nasaktan ka -tulad ng naramdaman ko noon?" hinampas niya ang balikat nito. "Look at me, Kerky! Hindi naman ako ito eh! I'm
                                            not a bitch! I don't smoke anymore but you birng out all the bad habits in me! You're a bad habit! I don't want you in my life!"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Sa inis niya ay lumabas siya ng sasakyan. She realized that hey were in the middle of a hi-way. She started walking. Kailangan niyang makaalis sa lugar na iyon. She doesn't want anything to do with Kerky. She hates
                                            him. What was she thinking when she realized that she was still in love with him? It's been years! Hindi na posibleng mangyari ang bagay na iyon. Galit siya kay Kerky! Iyon lang ang nararamdaman niya para dito.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Are you going to walk away everytime I try to talk some sense out of you?!" narinig niyang sigaw nito mula sa likuran. Hindi niya ito pinansin. She just kept on walking. Bakit na siya makikinig dito eh wala naman
                                            totoo sa sasabihin nito sa kanya? She hates the guy, he would only lie to her so what's the point of having this fucking conversation?
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"What's the point of listening to you? You're a fucking liar!" sigaw niya. Hindi pa rin niya ito nililingon.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I'm a fucking liar?!" tila hindi makapaniwalang tanong nito. Huminto siya at hinarap si Kerky.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Yes! You're just gonna make up some stupid lies to make me believe that you're a good person just so you can get into my pants!" Iyon ang masakit na katotohanan sa buhay niya. Kerky only wanted him now because
                                            she's pretty. Kung siya pa rin si Freaky Hanna ay sigurado siya na hindi siya pag-aaksayahan nito ng panahon.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"If I'm a fucking liar, then you're a stupid bitch!"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Nagpantig ang mga tainga niya. She's a stupid bitch? Anong karapatan nito para pagsalitaan siya ng ganoon?
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Fuck you, Kerky! I hated myself for years because of how you made me feel! I lost the will to get up every fucking morning because of what you did! Nagkaroon ako ng trust issues dahil sa'yo. Nawalan ako ng confidence!
                                            Bumaba ang self esteem ko and I needed consult a fucking shrink for a year para lang mawala ang depression ko! Now tell me dapat ba akong matuwa sa'yo?! You ruined my life!"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I ruined you're life?" sa pagkakataong iyon ay nakalapit na ito sa kanya. "Have you look into the mirror, Hanna? If I ruined your life, then why do you look like that now? If I ruined your life then why are you
                                            so confident of yourself, you have a good job, you have a career ahead of you. You got what you lost, your confidence, your self esteem, everything, you have it back now. If I ruined your life, anong tawag mo
                                            sa'yo ngayon?"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hindi siya kaagad nakasagot. Ano nga ba ang dapat niya sabihin? Kung tutuusin ay may punto ito. Kung tutuusin ay tama ang halos lahat ng sinabi nito sa kanya.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kung titingnan natin, Hanna, I made you that. If it weren't for me, you'd still be Freaky Hanna."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Matapos sabihin ni Kerky ang bagay na iyon ay itinaas niya ang kaliwang kamay niya upang padapuin sa mukha nito. She slapped him so hard, bumakat ang kamay niya sa mukha nito.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ang kapal ng mukha mo!" Itinuro niya ang sarili. "This is all because of you! I waited so long for this day na makakaganti ako sa'yo, tapos sisirain mo lang ang lahat!"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ganti? I told you, I'm giving you what you want! Gumanti ka na! Sinasabi mo na hindi ganoong kadali? Ano bang gusto mo? Masaktan ako? Gusto mong makita akong masaktan? Iyon ba ang gusto mo? Fine!"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hindi niya maintindihan ang sinasabi ni Kerky. Pinagmasdan lamang niya ito habang naglalakad ito palayo. Her eyes widened when she saw him stand in the middle of the desserted hi-way. Walang masyadong sasakyan,
                                            ngunit alam niyang dinadaanan ng mga behikulo ang lugar na iyon. Alam niyang maya-maya lamang ay may dadaan sasakyan doon.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kerky stopped in the middle of the hi way and looked at her. He even spread out his arms and closed his eyes.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kung magpapasagasa ako, masasaktan ako, then maybe if that happend, mapapatawad mo na ako. Iyon lang naman ang gusto mo diba? Ang makita akong masaktan? I'm giving it to you."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Nakadama siya ng panginginig ng tuhod. Hindi siya makagalaw. Pinanood niya lamang si Kerky habang nakatayo sa gitna ng hi way . Dapat bang may gawin siya? Pipigilan niya ba si Kerky.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Suddenly, put of nowhere, may narinig siyang isang busina. She looked at the other side of the hi-way. Nanlaki ang mga mata niya nang makiat niya ang isang FLAMMABLE na truck na papunta sa lugar ni Kerky. She bit
                                            her lower lip. Kahit nanginginig ang mga tuhod ay inilang hakbang niya ang distansya ni Kerky sa kanya upang itulak ito palayo.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">The next thing she knew, nagpapagulong-gulong na sila sa damuhan. Kerky's arms were around her as if trying to prevent her from hurting. Narinig niya ang truck na dumaan na. Matapos iyon ay pinaghahamapas niya ang
                                            dibdib nito. She was sitting on top of him, her tears were falling.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Ang tanga mo! Bakit ka magpapakamatay!" inis na inis siya dito. Napahagulgol na siya. Why would Kerky do that himself?
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hush...." bumangon ito upang umupo. Niyakap siya nito at pilit na pinapakalma. She kept on hitting his chest.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You're a stupid boy!" humahagugol na sigaw niya dito.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hush, baby.... stop..."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Hinagkan nito ang kanyang buhok. He was wiping her tears.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Tanga ka, bakit mo gagawin iyon!"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Because I want you to see how sorry i was for making you feel all of those things. I may be an asshole but I am a changed man now and I want you to see that because I don't want this war anymore. I'm in love with
                                            you, Hanna. God knows -how much I love you, so please, please open your heart and forgive me..." nagsusumamong wika nito. Lalo siyang napahagugol. She embraced Kerky so tight, she knew that he would find it
                                            hard to breath.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Wala na. Tapos na ang laban. She raised her white flag. Hindi na mahalaga para sa kanya kung nasaktan man siya ni Kerky noon o kung ano man ang plano niya para makaganti dito. Right in that moment, as she leans
                                            on his shoulders, nothing matters anymore except for the love she feels for Antonio Kerkmez.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Kerky smiled as he drove to that desserted hi-way. Hanna was beside him, sleeping like a little kid. She had that smile on her face and he wanted to believe that it was him who put it their. Alam niyang mahal niya
                                            ito. Hindi na kailangan pa ng maraming dahilan o pagkakataon o ng kahit na anong paliwanag para matanggap lamang niya sa sarili niya na mahal niya si Hanna. Ni hindi niya na inaalam sa kanyang sarili kung kailan
                                            nagsimula ang pagmamahal na nararamdaman niya para dito, basta ang malinaw lang ay mahal niya ito.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Maybe he had always loved her, maybe back when they were in high school, or maybe back then in the reunion when he first saw her. Hindi niya alam, hindi siya sigurado pero hindi naman iyon mahalaga. He had always
                                            looked for that one person who he'd want to spend his lifetime with, and now that he had found that person, he will never let her go.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Marahil ay tama si Jenny tungkol sa jinx. Ever since Hanna came back to his life, unti-unti nang naaayos ang buhay niya. Maayos na muli ang relasyon nila ng kanyang Nanay, wala na ang nararamdaman niya kay Ian --
                                            he was actually happy for her an Robi, unti-unti na ring nawawala ang kamalasan na noon ay tila ba nakabuntot lamang sa kanya at nawala na rin ang emptiness na nararamdaman niya because whenever she was with
                                            Hanna, the emptiness was replaced by happiness and completeness.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Eyes on the road, Kerky.." Nagulat siya nang bigla itong magsalita. She didn't realized that she was now awake. Umayos ito ng upo at saka ngumiti sa kanya. He prayed so hard that, that smile meant nothing but pure
                                            love, sana wala itong bahid ng paghihiganti o galit tulad ng mga naunang ngiting ibinibigay nito sa kanya.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You complete me." maemosyong wika niya dito. Sa kabila ng dilim ay nakita niya ang pamumula ng mukha ni Hanna. She took his hand and put it near her face.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"I hope this is not a dream because if it is, I'm so gonna kill you." nakatawang wika nito. He smiled too.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"You love me?" tanong niya. Hanna made a face.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Wala namang element of surprise kapag sinabi ko sa'yo ang sagot. Saka hindi ako easy to get. Ligawan mo muna ako."
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Diba niligawan na kita dati?"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi counted yon! Galit ako noon sa'yo eh!"
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Kasalanan ko ba iyon?" natatawang sabi niya. Sukat binatukan siya ni Hanna.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Heh! Sige, ganyanin mo na naman ako!" Lumabi pa ito.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hindi na, sige na, liligawan na kung liligawan. Wala naman akong sinabing hindi."

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">"Hmp. Dapat lang noh. Kundi sinasabi ko sa'yo!" bahagyang sinuntok pa siya ni Hanna sa braso. Matapos iyon ay nagkatinginan silang dalawa at sabay nagtawanan.
                                        </p>

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">It was a good day, he thought as he drove in that desserted hi-way. A good day because he now have the woman of his dreams beside him, and she had accepted the fact that he was in love with her.

                                        <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">Agad na sinilip niya si Menchie mula sa kanyang cubicle. Mabilis siyang tumayo nang makita niyang may dala itong isang boquet ng red roses at papalapit sa kanya. Nakangiting sinalubong niya ang kaibigan.

                                            [1] My Wattpad Love &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dedicated:
                                            To Wattpad for being such a nice website :) and my boyfriend. Rob, I love you! This is the work of fiction. Remember that. My wattpad love. Four words. It is unbelievable how four words can change your life.
                                            I will never understand how such little quantity of letters can change your life forever. Phrases like "I truly love you" or "I really like you" are so powerful and strong; they can warm your heart in a matter
                                            of seconds. They can lead you to happiness. But it was not one of those phrases the one that changed my life. It was a much simpler phrase, one I never expected to read. It was past midnight. I was surfing on
                                            the internet like every Saturday night. After finishing a bowl of ice cream by myself, I was hyperactive and couldn't sleep. I guess the extra sugar in my system was not really helping. I was lying on my stomach
                                            moving my finger along the pointing device of my Hp laptop. I was searching for stories to read, I ran out of paper books so I decided to try those so famous online books. I was not having any success; most
                                            of the pages that offered the mentioned books were kind of expensive. I would have paid for those books that caught my attention but hey, I was seventeen. I barely had money for lunch at school. Besides, those
                                            websites asked for credit cards and I was really far away from getting one of those. Sighing in frustration, I was about to give up when I saw an orange icon and the word free. I clicked on it and the internet
                                            explorer showed me wonderland: Wattpad. My eyes widened in shock as I read the website's mottos: unlimited stories, free eBooks, free download for your phone. As I scroll down the page, I discovered many stories.
                                            Many tittles caught my attention. I wanted to read them all. I could not believe I could read all those amazing stories for free. My heart started hammering inside my chest in excitement. For the first few days,
                                            I was a silent reader. I didn't have an account so I simply enjoyed reading the stories I liked. But then I felt the need to support those writers who spend hours on their books so I created an account. I was
                                            soon fanning people and commenting on stories to show my support. A month later, I was an addict. I checked wattpad three times per day to see if the stories I was following were updated. "Are you listening
                                            to me?" Laura, my best friend, asked as we walked to school one day. "Huh?" I asked closing the wattpad app on my IPhone. "You never listen to me, Julie. It's getting on my nerves," she complained walking faster,
                                            leaving me behind. "Lau, wait!" I screamed running after her. I couldn't help it. Wattpad had become my guilty pleasure. I tried to balance things, you know, hanging out with my friends and spending time on
                                            wattpad but it was hard. However, after a few weeks I managed to find the perfect balance. Whenever I was with my friends, I wouldn't take my IPhone out of my pocket because I knew if I did I would succumb to
                                            the need of checking wattpad. Anyway, you are probably wondering about those four words that changed my life. Well, it happened one afternoon after getting home from school. I turned my laptop on and immediately
                                            logged in wattpad. It was then my eyes caught that phrase... Share your own story. Four words, seventeen letters... I had always liked writing. I had a few un-finished stories in my laptop but never got the
                                            courage to finish them because I was lazy. Besides, I honestly never thought people would read them. It took me a few days to decide whether to post them or not. Clicking on the upload section and then on post
                                            a new story, I uploaded my first story. To say I was nervous is an understatement, I was terrified. I would check my mail each five seconds to see if I got a comment or anything. After two days of agony, my
                                            IPhone buzzed in my pocket. It was an email from wattpad "XxxxxX commented on your story" my heart came to a halt. I clicked on the link and proceeded to read the comment: "I love it, you should write more!
                                            Upload soon!" I almost jumped in joy as I read it. Someone liked my story; someone had actually read my story and enjoyed it. I was grinning from ear to ear as I replied to her comment. I thanked for her for
                                            the nice comment. That was how everything started. Those four words had really gotten me into something I loved. I uploaded chapter after chapter, gaining more fans and making new friends in the process. That
                                            was what I enjoyed the most from wattpad, the fact that I got to meet people from every corner of the world. But then it happened. I was lying comfortable on my bed while reading on my IPhone when my phone buzzed,
                                            announcing I got a mail. Smiling, I clicked the mail opened. "Dark_poet001 sent you a message" What an interesting username! I thought smiling. I was in such a good mood that day. I clicked on the link that
                                            would lead me to my message board and frowned as I read the message: "Your story is really girly, don't you think? It is not good if you ask me, I do not understand how it is so famous, its plot is not original
                                            at all." My finger froze on my IPhone's screen. My good mood went down the drainage. Those words hurt me like hell. I cannot even describe the way they made feel. I was devastated. I had never got such a negative
                                            message in the two months I'd been on wattpad. I was sure the page was promoting a friendly environment but there were definitely people out there who didn't know how to be nice. I went to the profile of the
                                            person who sent this message and frowned even more. It was a guy. It was not very common to find males in this site. I read his profile info in silence: Name: Don't need to know, stalker. Location: Read the
                                            above. Gender: M Language: English. Member since: Dec 2010. Votes received: 10,859 He had posted two stories and a collection of dark poems. His profile info white box was empty. He didn't write anything about
                                            him. His profile picture was blank, literally blank. I struggled not to write insults on his message board. That would not make things better. I was going to prove him I was more mature and civilized than him.
                                            I carefully typed my message: "Hello there, dark poet. I understand if you didn't like my story, but there was no need to be so rude. Hugs, Jules." I pressed the send button. I didn't even get the chance to
                                            breathe when my phone buzzed announcing he had replied. Really? This guy was fast! My eyes narrowed at his reply. @JulesRocks Touched a nerve? ;) I bit my lower lip in anger and quickly clicked the reply option.
                                            @Dark_poet001 Hey, I'm just saying there's not need to be so rude. If you don't like my story just don't read it. Save your rudeness for yourself. After a few minutes he replied: @JulesRocks Cut the drama, girly.
                                            This is not one of your stories, this is the real world ;p and that, my friends, was how an epic argument started: Me: First of all, don't call me girly. I don't know you. Second, I'm not being dramatic. It
                                            wouldn't kill you to be nice. Him: Why would I be nice to you? I don't know you. Me: Exactly, you don't know me. There is no reason for you to be rude to me. Him: ;) Whatever, girly. Me: Don't call me that.
                                            Him: It suits you. Me: It doesn't! Just be nicer the next time you want to say your opinion about a story. Him: Oh, did I hurt your feelings? Me: Yes. I thought for a moment he was going to apologize, how stupid
                                            of me to think that! Him: You want to cry on my shoulder, girly? ;) Me: Can't you just apologize? Him: Nope. Me: I give up. Just don't talk to me ever again. Him: Aww you're breaking my heart, girly. Can't you
                                            see? Me: Shut up! Being sarcastic is not really helping. Him: I think it is ;) Me: Why are you so mean to me? Him: Because. Me: Because...? Him: No reason :) Me: Just stay away from me. Him: You are the one
                                            who's on my profile. Leave, stalker. Me: I am not stalking you. I came here to see if we could get to an agreement. I want you to understand that your rude messages hurt people. Him: Blah blah blah. Me: You
                                            are.... Him: Can't think of a proper insult, Mrs. Strawberry? Me: Strawberry? What the... Him: Yeah, you're like a strawberry. Your stories are so cheesy. Me: You are unbelievable. Him: Thanks ;) Me: It was
                                            not a compliment! Him: it was for me ;) Me: I'm out of here. Him: Go, shoo! You're staining my page with your pink fingertips and strawberry's smell. I got out of his page fuming. This guy was unbelievable!
                                            He had no manner or respect for people. I could feel my heart beating desperately inside my chest. Arg! I buried my face in my pillow and growled in anger. He really got on my nerves. How could he be so rude?
                                            My phone buzzed and I slowly checked the screen. It was a new mail. "Dark_poet001 sent you a private message" I clicked on it and frowned reading it: "It was nice talk to you, Mrs. Strawberry. This is not over
                                            :)" I squeezed my fists. Oh, it's on! X - X That was the first chapter. Next chapter will be more exciting, I promise. Hugs, Arix. ******************************************* [2] Chapter 02 *******************************************
                                            A/N: Thank you guys for the support! I just want you to know the chapters for this story will be kind of short. And there'll be a lot of chat dialogue so if it's not your thing, I understand! Love u all, Arix!
                                            My Wattpad Love "Julie..." a low whisper dragged me out of sleep. I opened my eyes slowly, my sight was blurred for a few seconds but it quickly adjusted to my surroundings. The first thing I saw was my bed.
                                            It was a few meters away; the purple sheets were perfectly fixed. Wait...if my bed was so far away, then where was I sleeping? As if my mind wanted to reply, pain shot through my neck. It was then I realized
                                            my face was lying on my laptop's keyboard; I was sitting in front of my desk. I got my face off the keyboard, my cheek stung, I was sure I had letters marked on my skin. "Ow," I exclaimed rubbing my neck. How
                                            I managed to sleep in such uncomfortable position, I had no idea. I couldn't even remember falling asleep in the first place. My room was only lightened up by the small lamp on my night stand. "Julie," the same
                                            voice repeated and I scanned my room to find it empty. I frowned. What the-"Julie," the voice sounded more urgent this time. I was still half-sleep. I got up and started walking like a zombie towards my window.
                                            My house was a two-story one so my room was on the second floor. There was a big full moon on the sky "Julie!" I took a look outside but found nothing so I lifted my gaze to the sky "Julie," "God?" I asked scared.
                                            But then, a flying rock hit my forehead "Ow!" "Wake up! Damn it!" I held my forehead and looked down at my garden frowning. "Jason?" I scowled at him. He was standing behind a bush between my mother's flowers.
                                            He was my best friend since kinder garden "What the hell! You hit me!" I whined rubbing my forehead. "Throw the sheet, I need to talk to you," Jason usually sneaked in my house. I would throw a prepared sheet
                                            and he would climb it like a monkey. My window was not really high anyway. "What? Are you out of your mind? It's..." I trailed off; I didn't know what time it was "It's late!" I finished unsure. "It's an emergency,"
                                            "What type of emergency? "Type Y," my eyes widened. Jason and I had created some sort of code, the types of emergency went from V to Z. Believe me, Y was a very grave one. I searched under my bed to find the
                                            sheets and then threw it over my window. In a matter of seconds, Jason jumped inside my room. His brown hair was messy as if he had run his finger through it many times. "What happened?" "I need a condom," I
                                            gasped as his blunt reply. "What?! Are you serious?" I asked exasperated. "It's an emergency!" he exclaimed with pleading eyes. "That is not an emergency! Buy your own condoms, you cheap whore!" I slapped his
                                            shoulder. "Please, Jules, please," he begged. "No," "Come on! It's not like you're using them anyway," "Get out," I stated pushing him to the window. "The drug store is closed. You know there's no other place
                                            where I can get condoms at this time, please!" I knew he was being honest. There was only one drug store in the entire town. Sighing in defeat, I walked to my dresser and found some condoms. I was a virgin but
                                            hey, that doesn't mean I wasn't prepared. Besides, my mother was a doctor. When she gave me the "talk" she made sure to provide me with a big quantity of condoms. I threw them rudely to Jason. He caught them
                                            in midair and grinned at me. "Stop using the emergency code for these types of things," I said folding my arms across my chest. Jason held my face and kissed my forehead. "I love you, you're the best friend
                                            ever," and with that he climbed out of my window. Yawning, I got on my bed. My IPhone was under my pillow; I grasped it and checked my mails. I hadn't bothered on replying earlier to that rude boy from wattpad.
                                            I was too busy writing a chapter for one of my stories when I'd fallen sleep. It was 2:30 am. Wow, I should be sleeping. Curiosity filled my veins so I went to his profile. His last status was 28 minutes ago.
                                            I scowled at his words: Cleaning out my message board, it had pink fingerprints everywhere, Ew! He had to be kidding me! What the hell was wrong with him? Could he just let it go? I touched the private message
                                            he'd sent me to open it. Quickly, I started typing a message to him. Can you just let it go? I pressed send and almost jumped in surprised when my IPhone buzzed. Jeez, that boy was fast! Him: No. Me: What's
                                            your problem? Him: You are my problem. Me: Why? Him: Because. I growled in frustration and was about to reply when he sent another message. Him: What are you doing? Me: Like I would tell you that. Him: It's
                                            late where you live. Me: How do you know? Him: you wrote it on your profile. You are not really bright, are you? Me: Stalker much? Him: Technically, you are stalking me. You are the one getting in my profile
                                            and you messaged me first. Me: No, you messaged me first! Him: Whatever. You didn't answer my question. Me: Why do you want to know what I'm doing? Him: Just curious. Me: Freak. Him: Strawberry girl. Me: Stop
                                            calling me that! Him: Make me. Me: You are impossible! Him: Thanks ;) Me: My God, it was not a compliment! Him: I know. So are you doing something you shouldn't? &gt;=) Me: What do you mean? Him: You don't want
                                            to tell me what you're doing so I'm going to start assuming things. Me: What? Him: Are you watching porn? Me: No! Are you out of your mind?! Him: then what are you doing up? It's 2:54 am where you live. Me:
                                            I was just... helping a friend. Him: At this time? Me: Yeah Him: A male friend? Me: That's not of your business. Him: ;) Curiosity kept filling my veins so I decided to ask him something. Me: What's your name?
                                            Him: Darkpoet001 :) Me: No, I mean your real name. Him: Why do you want to know, Mrs. Strawberry? Me: Dear God! Stop calling me that! Him: Or what? You will hug me to death and throw strawberry pies at me? ;)
                                            Me: You are unbelievable! Him: I know ;) Me: I'm out of here. I don't know why I waste my time talking to you. Him: That hurt! Me: Right, bye! Before I could put my IPhone away he replied: My name is Evan :)
                                            Night, Sweet Jules. xMWLx ******************************************* [3] Chapter 03 ******************************************* Thanks for the great support! Love you, guys! My Wattpad Love "Julie Anne Jones!"
                                            I jumped awake, blinking quickly trying to clear my blurred sight. My mother's angry voice had the power of waking me up in one second. The morning sunlight was coming through the window. Shoot! I was probably
                                            late for school. I heard my mother's coming footsteps and clumsily tried to get out of my bed, key word here: Tried. My legs entangled with my sheets so I ended falling forwards to the floor. It was a good thing,
                                            I had reflexes otherwise my face would have crashed into cold surface if I hadn't got my hands on it first. I tried to stand but the damn sheet wouldn't let go of my leg. My door was swung opened, and there
                                            she stood: Carla Jones, my sweet mother, well 'Sweet' wasn't an adjective that suited her in that moment. "Hi," I greeted nervously. She folded her arms across her chest, giving me a disapproving look. "Can
                                            you explain to me, why my daughter is still on bed on a Monday's morning?" "Technically, I'm not on my bed," I defended pointing the floor beneath me. "Very funny," she faked a laugh "Be ready in five minutes,
                                            Julie. I won't allow you to be late for school," "Five minutes?" I whined. "Time is running," "But-" "And you have no time for breakfast. You'll eat a nutritional biscuit on the way," "Mom!" "Four minutes,"
                                            I groaned and quickly moved to my closet. My mother was a nice person but she was very strict and disciplined. I attributed it to her career. Medical School was tough. She graduated from it when I was nine,
                                            I knew it'd been hard for her to take care of me and attend to Medical school at the same time. But she had no choice. We were on our own. My father was a huge blur for me. I barely remembered seeing him when
                                            I was a child. He left us, Mom never explained to me why. It was a delicate theme for her. Even though, she had a temper I'd learn to love her just the way she was. She always went by the rules and God saves
                                            me if I did something wrong or didn't follow her commands. The ride to school was silent, which was rare; my mother usually attacked me with her doctor's babbling about my unhealthy sleep time. I was more of
                                            a night person, if you haven't noticed. I watched through the window as the trees rushed by. It was then I remembered him. Evan... I couldn't help but wonder what he was doing right now. Was he sleeping? Why
                                            was I thinking about him this early in the morning anyway? He was just some annoying rude boy I met on the internet. But he intrigued me, I couldn't deny it. My IPhone buzzed in my jacket's pocket and I jumped
                                            in surprise. My mother glanced at me coldly and quickly, her eyes were back on the road. I sighed, she was obviously mad at me. Checking my phone, I couldn't stop the smile that crept to my lips. It was a mail
                                            from wattpad. I can't remove your disgusting strawberry's scent from my wall. Bah! Evan's message made me chuckle. Even though, he was discretely insulting me. Again. I couldn't help finding funny his entire
                                            Mrs. Strawberry thing. For some reason, I didn't feel insulted by it anymore. I quickly typed a reply: You couldn't stop yourself for messaging me, could you? By the time he replied, I was already out of my
                                            mother's car and heading to the school's entrance. Dozens of teenagers were gathering around while others were entering the school. Him: Don't flatter yourself, girly. I'm just bored. Me: Yeah, right. You were
                                            bored so you decided to talk to the writer you hate, that doesn't make any sense. Him: It does to me ;) Me: You're so weird. Him: So I've been told. Me: You still owe an apology, you know that, right? Him: An
                                            apology? Psst, what would I apology for? Me: Well, for many things but your rude message about my story is what comes to mind right now. Him: I won't apologize for being honest. Your story is cheesy, admit it
                                            and move on. Me: Honesty? You call that honesty? Him: Yeah. Me: I don't even know why I waste my time on you. Him: Neither do I. I narrowed my eyes at my IPhone's screen. He was such a jerk! I was about to reply
                                            when I crashed into someone's hard chest. Strong hands caught me saving me from a painful fall on my ass. Manly cologne's hit my nostrils and I looked up. My jaw almost dropped to the floor in shock and I could
                                            feel the blood filling my cheeks. I was in the arms of Shane Mason, the school's popular golden boy. His hazel eyes were looking right into my blue ones paralyzing me. His blond brownish hair was messy in a
                                            sexy way. His perfect features were envied by most of the guys in this school and worshipped by the entire female population. I didn't know what to say, well, true was I couldn't say anything. I was shocked
                                            by the fact that this beautiful boy was holding me. Shane smirked at me arrogantly, probably thinking I was dazzled, which I was but I quickly tried to put on a careless facade. I cleared my throat. "You should
                                            watch where you're going," he said curtly, letting go of me. I stumbled backwards and lifted my chin, trying to maintain my dignity "You should also comb your hair, have you ever heard of hairbrush?" my mouth
                                            was opened in shock. How dare he! I was a shy person but if you mess with my hair, you mess with my life. Let's just say, it's a sensitive subject for me since the day my first school's boyfriend dumped me because
                                            my hair was ugly. I was ten when that happened but it still marked me. "Have you ever heard of manners?" I retorted folding my arms across my chest. "Oh, it speaks!" he exclaimed in mock surprise. I glared at
                                            him and stepped aside to walk past him. Successfully, I managed to take five steps away when he spoke again from behind, "I think this belongs to you," I glanced at him, ok more like glared at him over my shoulder.
                                            My eyes widened when I spot the black phone in his hand: My IPhone. I rushed towards him and went to snatch it from his hand but he raised it, keeping the phone out of my reach. "Give it back," I demanded as
                                            I jumped as high as I could. The bastard was so tall that he didn't even look preoccupied by my futile attempts of getting my phone back. He stared at me, amusement plastered on his face. "Do my math homework
                                            and I will give it back," "What?" I asked in disbelief. "You heard me," "I will not do such a thing!" Didn't he know I was almost failing math? I wasn't really good with numbers, wait... "You think I'm a nerd?"
                                            I asked touching my own chest. He shrugged his shoulders. "Aren't you?" I shook my head. "No, now, give me my phone back," "Nope, you have to be a nerd otherwise why would you come to school looking so...unfeminine?
                                            I mean, those baggy pants and t-shirt don't fit you. Anyone could mistake you for a boy," to say I felt insulted was an understatement. My face heated in anger and I clenched my fists. The next thing I did was
                                            something I would remember for the rest of my life... no, it was something I'd remember even in the afterlife: I slapped Shane Mason. My palm hit his left cheek hard, he was dumbfounded. Taking advantage of
                                            his reaction, I snatched my phone away and ran away like a crazy person. I spent the rest of the day, watching my back. I felt like a ninja, checking every corner I was about to cross, hiding behind books and
                                            cafeteria's trays. I had a gut feeling that Shane wasn't going to let this go. In my defense, he earned that slap by pulse. I still couldn't believe I had done that, I wasn't a violent person but he really pushed
                                            my buttons. "Julie, what's going on?" Laura, my best friend, asked as we headed to our chemistry class. I was keeping my bag against my face, covering myself. "Hum, I'm in trouble," "Why?" "I hit someone," "What?"
                                            Laura sounded surprised. Like I said, I wasn't a violent person and she knew that "Who? What happened?" "Shane," I whispered so low that for a moment I thought Laura didn't catch it. "Shane? As in Shane Mason?
                                            Hot Shane?" "Uhum," I nodded. "Really?" she stopped walking and got on my way, facing me "Tell me exactly what happened," I opened my mouth to reply when my phone buzzed in my pockets. "I'll tell you later,"
                                            I offered as I checked my phone. My face brightened up when I saw it was an email from wattpad but I frowned when I saw it was a comment on my one of my stories. Don't get me wrong, I loved the comments my fans
                                            leave and I read each one of them smiling like an idiot. It was just that I hoped it was a message from Evan. My phone buzzed again and I couldn't help grinning like an idiot when I saw it was a message from
                                            him. Did he read my mind or something? Him: Boo. Me: You really can't survive without me, can you? :) Him: Nah, I just enjoy annoying you. Me: Right. Him: I have the hope I can persuade you into writing good
                                            stuff instead of cheesy novels. Me: My stories are not cheesy! Stop saying that! Him: They are, someday, you'll admit it. Me: Whatever. Him: ;) Me: Why do you keep messaging me? It's obvious you don't like me.
                                            Him: I told you. You entertain me. Me: How? Him: What color is your underwear? I could feel my cheeks turning bright red as I replied: Me: You are a pervert! Him: I bet my PS3 that you are blushing right now.
                                            See? That's how you entertain me, you're a predictable girl. Me: You don't know me! Him: I know enough about you. Me: What's that supposed to mean? I scowled and felt stupid because he couldn't see my face.
                                            Him: Writers always leave pieces of their selves in their stories. So basically, by reading your stories i know a lot about you. Me: My characters are not real. Him: But they all have a piece of you. I didn't
                                            know what to say to that. He was probably right. Me: You're weird. Him: No, I'm smart. Do you want me to prove it to you? Me: ???? Him: You are a shy girl. You prefer being on your computer because you're afraid
                                            of the real world. You like reading and writing (Obvious two but needed to point them out) you don't have a father; he left you when you were a child or something like that. Your mother has a stressing career;
                                            she's probably a lawyer or a doctor. You don't have many friends, you don't like being wrong. You don't let many people get closer to you because you are afraid they will leave you like your father did. And
                                            lastly, you don't have a boyfriend," I was utterly and simply shocked. How on Earth did he know all that? Was he a stalker? Me: Are you stalking me? Him: Nope, I'm a very observant person. I've got all that
                                            personal information by reading your stories. Me: That's impossible. Him: No, it's called intelligence. Me: You are weird, indeed. Him: thank you ;) Me: How old are you? Him: why? :) Me: I don't know... you
                                            just seem... Him: Older than you? Yes, I am. Me: So? Him: Does it matter? Me: Yeah, I want to know if you're a creepy old man. Him: Ha-ha, no, I'm not a pedophile so don't worry. Me: Why are you talking to me?
                                            Him: Because you are the opposite of me. Me: What do you mean? Him: Gotta go, talk you later, peachy girl. Me: Oh great! Another pet name! Him: you know you love them ;) Me: Whatever, creep. Him: ;) Bye. For
                                            some reason, I felt lonely after I was done talking to him. It still surprised me how much he seemed to know about me. Not even Jason or Laura knew that much about me. I mean, they didn't know how scared I was
                                            of the real world. They didn't know I was hiding behind my shell to protect myself. They only thought I was just a closed person. Evan was still a jerk and very rude to me but somehow he had softened. Or maybe
                                            I was just getting used to his rude replies. I shoved my phone inside my pocket and the bell rang. I'd had only one class left and I would be free to go. I would be able to leave this school unharmed. Yeah,
                                            I really hoped I didn't run into Shane on my way to my next class. It was easy, just two more hours and I'd be safe at home. Something in my gut told I was not going to get away so easily. And I'd been right.
                                            X MWL X ******************************************* [4] Chapter 04 ******************************************* Dedicated to all those who have voted and commented on this story. You guys rock! :D Love, Arix
                                            - Chapter 04 - After the torment that was gymnastics, I was finally heading out of school. Mom had texted me, saying she was going to be a little bit late so I was doomed to wait for her out in the cold. Even
                                            when winter was almost gone, the cold breeze was still whipping our town. I sat on a nearby bench and sighed watching students getting in their cars and chatting. I couldn't believe I had slapped someone as
                                            popular as Shane and got away with it. Being really bored, I got on wattpad and started checking my favorite discussions on the clubs. I would always spend time talking and sharing opinions with people there.
                                            It was then an idea occurred to me. I clicked on Evan's profile and entered his poetry collection. I wanted to know more about him. I read his poems and tears sprung to my eyes. They were so sad, and they were
                                            so well written that they got to my heart quickly. His username made more sense now "Darkpoet001" his poems were dark but they were also extremely sad. Motivated by curiosity, I clicked on one of his two stories.
                                            It was a thriller story about some murders and stuff like that, I'd read it later so I clicked on the other one. I opened my mouth surprised. It was about a boy, a lonely boy. The prologue described his sad
                                            thoughts about the world. Wanting to know more, I transported myself into the story as I read it in silence. The main character was so deep and thick, that I found myself very intrigued by him. The story developed
                                            in college, basically emphasizing all the steps the main character had to take to overcome his difficulties. He had lost his family and the love of his life. God, this boy knew how to get to someone's heart.
                                            Tears escaped my eyes while I was reading a very emotional scene. The girl he loved broke his heart; she dumped him for his best friend. How could she do that? I was so into the story that I forgot I was in
                                            the parking lot. I didn't notice a figure standing in front of me. Someone coughed obviously trying to get my attention but I ignored it. I needed to know what Josh, the main character, was to say to his former
                                            girlfriend. My phone was taken from my hands in a quick move. "Hey!" I exclaimed looking up "Uh-oh," I met Shane's hazel eyes; they held a glint of anger. I swallowed. "You owe me an apology," he stated coldly.
                                            "Me?" I aimed a finger to me innocently. "Yeah, you," "You insulted me! You deserved what you got," I said standing up "give me my phone back," "Don't mess with me, Jones," he pronounced my last name slowly.
                                            "Are you threatening me?" I scowled at him as he stepped closer to me. Worrying about my safety, I backed away. His lips formed a wicked grin. "Hit me again and you'll see," "See what?" I was not going to let
                                            him intimidate me. He grabbed my arm rudely pulling me to him. I struggled to release myself "Let me go!" "You are so..." he stated as he stared at me in silence. "Insult me again and I swear-" "Beautiful,"
                                            I gasped and couldn't help the blush filling my cheeks but then he laughed. I frowned as he let me go and gave me my phone back. He continued to laugh for a while "You should...have...your... face..." he said
                                            among his laughter. So it was a joke? Why didn't it surprise me? Of course, a guy like him would never think I was beautiful. I simply glared at him and felt relief when I spotted my mother's car. I walked past
                                            Shane but he grabbed my arm again stopping me "What's your name?" Oh Great, he knew my last name but not my name, so classy. "Megan Fox," I replied sarcastically. "You wish you were that hot," he said sternly.
                                            I slapped his hand and smiled at him. "You wish you knew my name," and with that I walked off. Unfortunately for me, my triumphal exit didn't last long. I didn't notice the parked car on my way and crashed into
                                            it with a thud "Ow!" my knee received all the damage. I jumped on one foot while rubbing my knee "Ow, ow, Ow" Shane approached to me chuckling, "Nice exit, Jones," he commented amused. "Shut up!" I exclaimed
                                            putting my hurt feet on the ground again. I started limping towards my mother's car. I got inside and slammed the door closed. My mother gave me a confused look but drove off in silence. I guess she was still
                                            mad at me. I spent the rest of the afternoon reading Evan's sad story. I wondered if that had really happened to him because it was really tragic. According to his story, her girlfriend had chosen his best friend
                                            over him. How could she do that? Why did I care so much anyway? It was probably just fiction, but something in my gut told Evan had had a difficult life. I didn't know how I knew this but I just sensed it. I
                                            was lying on my back, my laptop was resting on my belly. I was reading peacefully on wattpad, my eyes landed on the chat box. I had a new instant message. I smiled like a fool when I read the username "Darkpoet001"
                                            he had to be my fan otherwise there was no way he could appear in my chat box. Him: .... Me: What? Him: Hello, peachy girl. I rolled my eyes at his new nickname for me. Me: Hello, freak. Him: :) How are you?
                                            Me: Good and you? Him: Great ;) I had a dream about you. Me: Really? I asked in disbelief. Why was he being so nice? Maybe he was tired of being a jerk. My assumptions could not have been more wrong! Him: Yeah,
                                            I killed you in my dream. Me: so sweet! (Note sarcasm) Him: Nah, I didn't kill you. It was not nice dream though. Me: Why? Him: Because you were in it :/ Me: -.- Him: It was a nightmare, but oh well, how was
                                            your day? Me: Hm, not good. Him: Why? Me: I slapped someone. Him: hahaha really? Me: Yeah, it's not funny. Now I got an angry arrogant boy on my tail. Him: why did you slap him? Did he kiss you? Me: What? No!
                                            Him: Then...? Me: He insulted me. Him: Oh, you need a shoulder to cry on? ;) Me: No. Him: Bah, I'm being nice here. Me: You call this being nice? Your niceness sucks! Him: You hurt my feelings. Me: Yeah right
                                            Him: haha did you finish stalking my profile? Me: Psst, I wasn't stalking your profile Him: You are not a good stalker. If you were going to read my stories and poems, trying to figure me out, you shouldn't
                                            have voted for them. It's all in my newsfeed ;) "Damn!" I cussed aloud. I was such an idiot! Me: I don't know what you're talking about. Him: Whatever, girly. Me: Again with the nicknames -.-* Him: You know
                                            you love them. Me: I don't! Him: You do :) I was about to type a reply when my door swung opened crashing against the wall. My window shook for the impact. "I have returned!" Jason exclaimed pretending a British
                                            accent. He walked inside my room like he owned the place. I stared at him in silence. He looked rejuvenated and radiant. I guess he'd had a wild night. I narrowed my eyes at him. "You have a sign on your forehead
                                            that says 'I had sex all night'" I commented. "I had, indeed," I rolled my eyes. "Stop it with the accent, it doesn't suit you," "Someone's cranky," he pointed me and grinned "but do not worry, my lady," he
                                            bowed keeping his eyes on me "I am here to brighten your day," "I'm perfectly fine," "No, you're not. I heard you got on a fight with Shane this morning," "What? I didn't get on a fight with him. I just slapped
                                            him," Jason took his shirt off and fanned himself. Then, he threw himself on my bed, causing it to quaver at the sudden invasion. "Oh rumors," Jason shook his head disapprovingly "why did you slap him?" "He
                                            insulted me," I said absently while my eyes landed on my laptop again. I had two new instants messages from Evan. Him: Mrs. Strawberry? You there? Me: Kind of, my best friend's over. Him: Oh, talk to you later
                                            then :) Me: Yeah, sure. "What are you doing?" Jason crawled closer to peak on my laptop's screen; I closed it on his face. "Nothing," I gave him a closed mouth smile. He narrowed his green eyes at me. "What
                                            are you hiding?" he looked curious. "Nothing," I replied too quickly. He looked into my eyes. "Jules..." "Jason..." we usually got into this staring contest. Jason's eyes widened. "Oh my God! You are watching
                                            porn!" he exclaimed in disbelief. "What?! No! Why would I... no!" "Then let me see," "No," "Jules.." he menaced "let me see," "I am talking to someone, alright?" I admitted blushing slightly. "Is it a boy?"
                                            I nodded "Are you blushing? Ah! Thank God, I was starting to worry about your sexuality," I punched his shoulder hard "Ow! Don't blame me; you haven't had a proper boyfriend in years!" "Yeah but that doesn't
                                            mean I'm a lesbian," "Sorry," he grinned at me "So who is it?" "Jason, stop it. He is just... an acquaintance," "But you like him," "No, I hate him, and I'm sure the feeling is mutual," "Who could possibly hate
                                            you? You're as sweet as a peach," a smile crept to my lips as I remembered that was Evan's new nickname for me: Peachy girl. "Where were you last night?" I asked trying to change the subject. "Oh, I was with
                                            Helen," I glared at him. "You were with that sl-" Jason covered my mouth. "No insults, Jules. She is my friend," "Friend? Your definition of friend is sickly wrong. Friends don't screw each other," "Well, she's
                                            my special friend," he corrected. "Whatever, but the next time you appear on my window in the middle of the night and ask me for condoms. I will murder you and feed you to the dog," "You don't have a dog," Jason
                                            chuckled. "I could get one," Jason laughed and pinched my nose. "You're so cute when you try to look angry," "I am angry. You scared the hell out of me last night, not to mention the fact, you hit me with a
                                            rock," "Sorry about that," "Say that to the bruise on my forehead," "You don't have a bruise. Don't be dramatic, Jules," "Fine, just don't do it again," Jason looked guilty for a moment. "Actually, I was wondering..."
                                            "Oh no, no, no, don't tell me you're here for condoms," his guilty expression told me everything "Oh my God! Get out, Jason," "Please! I'm short on money and I'm seeing Helen tonight," "Again? What are you?
                                            A freaking rabbit?" "Jules, please," "No!" "Come on, it's not like you paid for them. Your mother gave you tons of them," "That doesn't mean I have to maintain your sex life. I'm not your pimp," I explained
                                            exasperated. Jason pouted and looked at me with puppy eyes. "You cannot let your best friend get a STD or get someone pregnant," he whined with baby voice. Sighing in frustration, I got out of bed and stalked
                                            to my drawer. Condoms in hand, I turned to Jason and was ready to throw them when my mother burst in. She looked at Jason, who was lying shirtless on my bed and then at me. "Julie Ann Jones! Can you explain
                                            to me what the hell is going on?" she placed her hands on her hips. Ughh, I was in trouble. X M W L X ******************************************* [5] Chapter 05 ******************************************* Thanks
                                            to him for the banner to the right :D The song is for an specific part of the chapter. You'll know :D My Wattpad Love Chapter 05 "Mom, wait," I whispered panicked as she stalked towards Jason. "Mrs. Jones, I
                                            can explain," Jason started sitting up. I dropped the condoms and approached to her. "Mom, it's not wha-" Bam! She slapped Jason right across the face. My jaw dropped to the floor in shock. "F*ck!" Jason exclaimed
                                            rubbing his cheek "What the-" "No cussing, mister!" she menaced placing her hands on her hips "I cannot believe this, I am so disappointed," "Jeez! Mom, it's not what it looks like! I was just-" my mother turned
                                            to me. "You were just what? Come on, keep talking. Enlighten me!" she said sarcastically. Her eyes were barely narrowed, a sign that she was really angry. I swallowed. "I was... he needs condoms but he's not
                                            going use them with me," I grimaced at the thought "He's short on money and since I have so many condoms, I was just going to give him some," my mother raised an eyebrow skeptically. "And he needs to be shirtless
                                            to get them?" I opened my mouth to reply but she cut me off "You expect me to believe that?" "It's the truth, mom. I swear, I'm still a virgin" I said frankly. She stared at me for a moment before looking at
                                            Jason. "Is that the truth?" She asked him seriously. Jason nodded frantically. "Yes, maa'm," mom sighed. "I hope you two are being honest here because if I find out you are sharing fluids-" "Mom!" I screamed
                                            disgusted. Sharing fluids? Who the fudge says that? She gave me a closed mouth smile and then became deadly serious. "I am watching you," she said aiming her fingers at her eyes and then at us, "So behave,"
                                            she ordered walking to the door "and you," she glanced at Jason "come on, go home now," "But-" "I don't want you around Jules for today," Jason sighed and put his shirt on, "Fine," he mumbled and grabbed a few
                                            condoms from the floor before heading to the door, "Who is she?" my mother started interrogating him as they walked out of the room. She closed the door behind them, poor Jason. I really didn't want to imagine
                                            the things mom would ask him or tell him. I didn't even want to go there. "Sharing fluids," I whispered shaking my head. If there was a prize for the most awkward disgusting phrases, mom would win easily. She
                                            had this great ability to come up with the most awkward lines I'd heard in my life. Maybe, she got that from being a doctor, I don't know but thanks God I didn't inherit it. Crawling back to bed, I took my laptop,
                                            opened it and placed it on my lap. My chat box was collapsed. Jeez, I had many messages from friends and fans from wattpad. But my eyes searched for one single username: Evan's. I clicked on Darkpoet001 and
                                            started typing. Me: I'm back :) Him: I can tell, Me: ?? Him: Yeah, your cloying smell alerted me of your presence. Me: Cloying smell? What the hell? Him: ;) Me: What are you doing? Him: Reading. Me: What are
                                            you reading? Him: "How to get rid of a cheesy writer" :D Me: -.- Hilarious. Him: Bah, you lack sense of humor. Me: Hum, I read your story. I had to ask him about it. Curiosity was killing me. Him: So? Me: Did
                                            it happen to you? Him: No. Me: It's written with so much passion that I thought it was a true story... the story of your life. Him: I said no. Drop it. Me: It's real, isn't it? Him: Are you blind? I said no.
                                            It's fiction; get it inside that small skull of yours. Me: Why are you getting angry then? Him: I'm not angry. Me: Yes, you are. Him: How would you know that? You cannot see me. Me: I can feel it. Him: You're
                                            wrong. I'm perfectly fine. Me: Did you lose your parents in a car accident? I asked him because that was what happened to the main character in his story. He didn't reply for a while. Him: Jules, drop it. Me:
                                            Why can't you just tell me? Him: Just f*cking drop it! Me: Evan... I just want to know, I want to help you. Him: Help me? Don't act like you know me. Me: You're right. I don't know you but that doesn't mean
                                            I don't want to know more about you. Him: Why? Me: I'm curious. Him: I have to go. Me: Fine, be a coward. Run away. Him: A coward? You dare to call me a coward? Me: You're being a coward right now. Running away
                                            so you don't have to deal with the pain. Him: Pain? What the hell are you talking about? Me: The pain of losing your parents. Him: It's not real! It's a fiction story, get it? I am not related in any way to
                                            that character. Me: I don't believe you. Him: I don't care. Me: Writers always leave pieces of their selves in their stories. You said it yourself. Him: That is not my case. Me: Isn't it? Darkpoet001 logged
                                            off. Did he just leave? Maybe, he was right. I should just drop it but I couldn't. I don't know how but I knew Evan needed someone to talk to. In his story, the main character always wished he had someone to
                                            talk to, to tell his fears and let the pain out. Maybe I was thinking too much about it, he was right. Not all the stories are based on true stories. Writers write about what they know and their characters may
                                            have resembles with their life but it doesn't have to be entirely real. Then why did I have this gut feeling Evan's life was as tragic as his character's? I frowned when Evan's chat box appeared with a green
                                            spot. He was online again. Him: My parents are dead. I don't want to talk about it. Me: Oh... okay. I'm sorry. Him: And if you feel pity for me, don't, I'm fine. Me: Okay but if you want to talk... Him: I don't.
                                            Me: Alright. He didn't reply for a while. Was it weird that I could feel the tension even when we weren't facing each other? Yeah, it was but I really needed to say something to lighten our conversation. Me:
                                            You were right. Him: About what? Me: I'm a cheesy writer. Him: You're admitting it? Me: Yeah Him: Finally, you realized it :) Me: But there's nothing wrong about writing cheesy novels. I'm a hopeless romantic,
                                            I love writing sweet love stories. I love writing about happiness and true love. Life is not just about tragedy and sadness. I like to focus on the good side of life. There's nothing wrong with that. Him: It's
                                            unrealistic. Me: What's the point of writing about tragedy? It'll do not good to anyone. Love stories give people hope. Him: False hopes. Me: How can you know that? I believe in soul mates. Him: Of course, you
                                            believe in that bullsh*t. Me: It's not bullsh*t. It's true. Him: Love does not exist much less soul mates. Me: Love exist. Him: Right, true love is in the air, just like the love your father felt for your mother
                                            when he left her. My heart sank in my chest. That was a low blow. inevitably, Tears sprung to my eyes. I held them back, I wouldn't let him get to me. Me: You're just a coward. You hide behind all those dark
                                            poems and thoughts because it's easier that way. why don't you face the pain, huh? Him: I'm perfectly fine. Me: Liar! him: I'm not lying. Me: Coward. Him: I am not a coward. Me: Prove it. Him: I don't have to
                                            prove anything to you. Me: Coward. Him: Stop. Me: Coward. Him: I am not a coward! My father killed my mother right in front of my freaking eyes! And then shot himself. I don't even know how I'm surviving so
                                            don't you dare calling me a coward after all I'm doing to keep going. My mouth hung opened in shock. I was speechless. I thought they'd died in a car's accident like in his story. Him: Don't say you're sorry.
                                            I hate it. Me: I don't know what to say. Him: Don't say anything. I'm fine. Me: I wish I could give you a hug. I regretted sending that but I felt the need to let him know I wanted to help him. Him: Ew! Don't
                                            tell me you have a crush on me :) I'll puke. I smiled sadly at his futile attempt to change the subject but went along with it. Me: Pffft! Never. Him: I know I'm hot and all but seriously you're too sweet for
                                            me. Me: Too sweet? Haha oh please, YOU are too dark for me. Him: I'm just realistic. You're painfully hopeful and cloyingly sweet, girly. Me: We're opposites then. Him: Yes and I hope you don't believe in that
                                            crap about opposites attract. Me: Nah, I don't. Him: Good :) Me: Can I tell you something? Him: Yeah. Me: I know you're trying to avoid the subject and I understand you don't want to talk about it. I just want
                                            you to know that I think you are amazing because you keep going after going through something so painful and traumatic. I admire you, you should be proud of yourself. And if writing sad poems and stories helps
                                            you deal with the pain, I completely understand. I guess life needs both sides, the good sappy one and the dark tragic one. There's absolutely nothing I can say to make you feel better. I'm merely an acquainted
                                            for you but I just wanted to say this :) You're still an arrogant jerk though. Him: You actually made me smile with your mild speech, peachy girl. Me: I'm glad I did. Him: I better go to sleep. Me: Sleep? It's
                                            like 8 pm. Him: It's not that time where I live. Me: Where do you live? Him: Like I would tell you that, stalker. Me: Right. Him: Listen to this song "I don't care" by Apocalyptica. Me: Why? Him: Just do it,
                                            night. Me: Night, Evan. Him: And Jules? Me: Yeah? Him: Thank you :) Darkpoet001 logged off. I couldn't help smiling like a fool. I felt like I had helped him somehow. I entered youtube and searched for the song
                                            he told me. I put my headphones on and I rested my back against the head board. a soft melody started playing until the singer began, "I try to make it through my life, in my way, there's you I try to make it
                                            through these lies, and that's all I do" I frowned. This song sounded so much like him, "Just don't deny it, Don't try to fight this ,and deal with it and that's just part of it," I frowned in confusion. "If
                                            you were dead or still alive I don't care, I don't care Just go and leave this all behind Cause I swear (I swear),I don't care" I couldn't stop myself from chuckling. I knew it wouldn't be anything sweet. Was
                                            this his way of telling me he didn't care about me? "I try to make you see my side Always trying to stay in line But your eyes see right through That's all they do," My heart started beating faster in my chest.
                                            Why was I feeling as if he was singing this song to me? As if he had dedicated it to me? It couldn't be possible. He was just trying to tease me about the entire I don't care thing, right? "Love changing everything
                                            You won't be left for me" I closed my laptop and took my headphones off. I could feel butterflies in my stomach and my heart was menacing to jump out of my chest. What was wrong with me? Why was I reacting like
                                            this to a song? why was I reacting like this at the thought of him dedicating it to me? I didn't know him. He was just someone I'd chatted with a couple of times. "Silly Jules," I whispered to myself and got
                                            out of bed. I walked to my drawers and passed in front of the mirror. I froze when I saw my reflection. My cheeks were tinted pink and my eyes held a glint i'd never seen before. What was wrong with me? It was
                                            just a song. Why did I feel this need to make him feel better? He'd been through so much. Why did I care? We were completely opposites. My Iphone started ringing snapping me out of my thoughts. I stared at the
                                            screen scowling: Unknown. "Hello?" "Hello, Jones," "Shane?" I asked in disbelief. "Yeah, don't drool over your phone. It's disgusting," "What-how-why," I rushed my words not knowing which question was more important.
                                            "Calm down, babe. Breathe," "Babe?" I grimaced in disgust. He was such a player. "You like it?" I rolled my eyes. "What do you want?" I didn't bother to ask him how he got my number. He was Shane Mason, one
                                            of the popular guys at school. He could get anything he wanted. He chuckled. "I need you to do my math homework," "What? You've have to be kidding me, I-" "I won't take a no as an answer," "I told you I'm not
                                            good at math, actually I su-" a knock on my room's door interrupted me. Oh no, time for dinner, mom was really stricted with timing "wait, hang on," "If you hang up on me, I will-" "I won't, just wait," I started
                                            as I opened the door. "I told you I wouldn't take a no as answer," Shane stood right in front of me, his phone on his ear. He was smirking at me, looking all smug and arrogant "close your mouth, babe. Don't
                                            wnat the flies to get inside," It was then I noticed my mouth was opened in shock. I shut it and put my phone down. "What the hell are you doing here? How did you get in here?" I felt utterly confused. not to
                                            mention, I was wearing shorts and a see-through white shirt. Shane pushed me aside and walked inside my room like he owned the place "what are you doing? Get out! I haven't gi-" "Jules," my mother called me.
                                            It was then I noticed she was standing in the doorframe, "be nice to Shaney," she ordered in a motherly tone. "Shaney?" I asked exasperated. "Yes, he's Mery's son, don't you remember?" Mery was my mother's best
                                            friend. Mom always talked about her, I had seen her like three times in my life. She was a doctor like my mother so she had a very tight schedule. I always thought the reason they were so close to each other,
                                            it was because they worked in the same place. Mery spent more time with my mother than me. "you mean, he's your godson?" I remembered mom telling about being the godmother of Mery's son but I never expected
                                            him to be Shane Mason. "Yes, isn't he sweet?" "Sweet?" I laughed sarcastically. Shane smiled kindly at my mother. "Help him with his math homework, darling," she said and left closing the door behind her. I
                                            was too shock to say something. What the hell had my life turn into? I looked at Shane, and he was standing there smirking at me. "Your face is priceless," "Oh shut up!" I held my head. I needed to find a way
                                            to get him out of here. Shane started at me with his big breath-taking hazel eyes and ran his fingers through his blond brownish hair. His gaze dropped to the floor and his smirk grew bigger. "You know," he
                                            came closer to me, I narrowed my eyes at him, "I'm glad you're thinking about protection," I stepped back until my butt hit the drawer. It was then I looked down and saw the condoms lying on the floor. Quickly,
                                            I started blushing. When I looked up, I gasped. Shane was too close. I pushed his chest. "Back off," he grasped my wrist. "Help me with my homework and I will," he leaned closer. His minty breath brushed past
                                            my face. "Get off me, pervert!" he looked at me waiting, "fine, I'll help you," he grinned and backed away. "This shall be fun," I forced a smile. "Yeah," Oh course, it'd be fun. I was going to have a lot of
                                            fun when he failed math because of me. Internally, I laughed evilly like Cruella de vil. Shane was so going down., x M W L X Long Chapter! Hope you enjoyed! Thank you so much for voting :D Love, Arix *******************************************

                                            funny moment when you're holding back laughter and the more you try not to laugh, the more you want to do it. I was living that exact moment.. I was looking through the little square glass on the Math's class
                                            door. Mr. Satty was giving out the Math's assignments grades. I couldn't get inside, I was a junior and this was a senior class. So I was stuck with watching from the hallway. I was patiently waiting for Shane
                                            to get his grade. I could not believe I was skipping Biology for this but I really wanted to see his face. He was sitting on one of the front seats, looking smug as he waited. He ran his fingers through his
                                            envied hair and smirked at some girl next to him. He looked so confident and relaxed. A giggle left my lips, it was becoming impossible to not laugh. "Shane Mason," Mr. Satty called out scanning the classroom.
                                            Shane stood up and walked to Mr. Satty's desk. He gave him his assignment and shook his head disapprovingly. Shane turned back to his seat; I could see his profile clearly. His smug smile vanished as his eyes
                                            rolled down the paper in his hands. I was covering my mouth tightly. God, his face was priceless. As if feeling my gaze, his head snapped towards the door. He looked at me angrily, I gasped. His eyes barely
                                            narrowed as he stalked towards me. Shoot! He's going to kill me or do something nasty like get his finger inside my ear. I'd always thought that was disgusting. I started to panic as he got closer; I really
                                            hadn't thought this through. I should've have a escape plan. God, I was such an idiot! Jordan, Shane's best friend, got on his way stopping him. Jordan started talking to him about something I couldn't hear.
                                            The bell rang. The phrase saved by the bell had never made as much sense in my life as it was doing it now. I took advantage of the commotion around and got away from the door to walk away. I heard Shane shouting
                                            my name from behind but didn't bother to look back. I entered the main hallway and started walking down fast. He was going to murder me but I couldn't help the triumphal smile that crept to my lips. His face...
                                            Oh God, I didn't even want to remember, it was hilarious. In my defense, he practically forced to help him with Math a few days ago. It was his fault he didn't believe me when I told him I sucked with numbers.
                                            "Jones!" Uh-oh, I glanced over my shoulder and panicked. Shane was sprinting towards me. Anger plastered on his face, his fists clenched at his sides. Immediately, I started running away. I cursed my short legs,
                                            they weren't really helping in my futile attempt of a escape "Jones! You are so dead!" I started zigzagging in the hope of misleading him. Yeah, it wasn't the brightest idea but hey, I was scared. My eyes met
                                            heaven when I spotted the precarious hanging sign that said "Bathroom" without a second thought, I opened the door and ran inside. I rested my back against the door breathing heavily. I was safe. He wouldn't
                                            enter the girl's bathroom, would he? I looked up and froze. There was a guy standing a few meters from me. He was holding his little buddy with one hand as he stood in front of the urinal. I screamed so loud,
                                            my ears were ringing after it. "Oh my God! Oh my God!" I repeated over and over again. The guy didn't seem to move a muscle "I'm so sorry! Oh my God!" The guy was red as a tomato. Leave it to me to go inside
                                            the wrong bathroom. I had never seen a man's "thing" in my life. I was terrified. To extend my misery, someone pushed the door opened, hitting the back of my head. I stumbled forwards and turned on my feet ready
                                            to fight Shane. To my surprise, it was Jason. "What the hell?" Jason looked at the guy, who was finally pulling his zipper up and then at me, "Are you... Did you... Jules?" He was obviously waiting for an explanation.
                                            The guy walked out of the bathroom embarrassed. "It's not what it looks like," I stated. The image of the guy's member wouldn't get out of my head. It was shocking to see one in real life. Jason narrowed his
                                            eyes at me, "Then what wer-" "Jones!" Shane's angry voice sounded closer to the door. Jason frowned. "Is tha-" "I need to hide," I whispered scanning the bathroom. "Why? Jules, what's going on? What ar-" "Shut
                                            up! This is an emergency!" "You need a condom?" "What? No, distract him," I ordered as I entered one of the cubicles and shut the metal door. "Jules, wha-" "Jones!" By the sound of his voice, Shane was in the
                                            bathroom "Where is she?" "Who?" Jason asked innocently. "That little devil you call your best friend," he spoke bitterly. I swallowed as I got on the toilet bowl. Oh look at me, this was such a clichÃ© moment.
                                            I really hoped I didn't slip and fell down. It would pretty disgusting if that happened. "Jules?" Jason was not really good at lying, "she got in the girls' bathroom, why?" I could not blame Jason for not defending
                                            me straight away from Shane. Shane was taller, bigger and an athlete. He could beat the crap out of my best friend easily. "You better not be lying," Shane said and the sound of the door being closed relaxed
                                            me. "Jules, stay there until the bell rings, he's in the hallway," Jason informed me "I'm going for back-up, okay?" "Back-up? What are you? A cop?" "Stay there," "Fine!" I got off the toilet bowl and got my
                                            Iphone out of my pocket. Evan and I had become sort of online friends. We would talk all day, if we weren't busy. It surprised me how many things we had in common, we listened to the same bands, watched the
                                            same shows and shared a passionate obsession with donuts. He wouldn't tell much about himself though, I mean, he didn't like talking about his personal life. He wouldn't even tell me where he lived for God sakes.
                                            Me, on the other hand, I was an opened book. I just felt so comfortable when I talked to him, maybe, because I couldn't see him. It was easy to write about your life than speak of it, if you know what I mean.
                                            I started to type a message to him: Shane is gonna kill me. I pressed the send button. Evan knew about Shane, Jason, Laura and even my mom. Yeah, I wasn't really a reserved person. Besides, for some reason I
                                            trusted Evan. I know it sounds crazy but he was just so... I didn't have words to explain it. Him: I'm fine, thank you. Where are your manners? I rolled my eyes. Me: this is a life and death situation and that's
                                            all you can say? Him: Yeah ;) but I will spare you this time. Me: I may die in the next few minutes. Choose your words carefully; they may be the last ones you write to me. Him: You are so dramatic. You are
                                            not going to die, stop being a chicken and face him. Me: you don't know him. He can murder me in a heartbeat. I look like a dwarf in front of him. Him: haha I bet you look like a dwarf in front of me, too. His
                                            reply got me thinking about his appearance. How did Evan look like? His wattpad profile picture was blank so I had no clue. Me: are you tall? Him: I'm taller than you. Me: how would you know that? Him: common
                                            sense. I'm older, I'm a man so I'm 99% sure, I'm taller than you. Me: how old are you? Him: haha how many times are you going to ask me that? Me: until you tell me. Him: I won't ;) Me: Evan, do you have a facebook?
                                            Him: No. Me: Twitter. Him: No. Me: anything? Him: No, only wattpad. I don't like those websites. They're useless. Me: Evan, I'm curious. Him: Let me guess, you want to know how I look like, don't you? My eyes
                                            widened in surprise. It was like he could read my mind. Me: Yeah. I admitted embarrassed. Him: I'm ugly. Me: I didn't ask you if you were beautiful whatsoever. I want to see you, to put a face to the blank inside
                                            my head when I speak to you. Him: Someday, I may send a picture to you. Someday? I growled frustrated. Me: Why are you so reserved? Him: The less you know about me, the better. Me: Why? Him: Trust me :) Me:
                                            You're so weird. Him: You've already said that many times, little peach. Me: Little peach? Him: Yeah, by the way, how come you write romance stories if you haven't been in love before. Me: How do you know I
                                            haven't been in love? Him: I told you, I'm a very observant person. Me: Right, you're such a stalker. him: haha you wish I was stalking you :) Me: Oh please, you are stalking me. You may admit it someday, just
                                            like I admitted my stories were cheesy. him: Nah, why would I stalk you? I don't know you. I narrowed my eyes at the screen. Me: At this point, I think we are friends. Him: Friends? haha maybe. I was about to
                                            reply when the bell rang. Me: I have to go. Him: :) Ok, little peach. Me: You have the worst taste on pet names. Him: They suit you. Me: Yeah yeah, talk to u later. I shoved my phone inside my bag and left the
                                            bathroom as fast as I could. I really didn't want to see another guy's little buddy. I'd had enough for the day. ** "You did what?" Laura asked shocked. Her green eyes were widened. Her brown hair was falling
                                            down her shoulders. She looked good today, which remained me of my crappy outfit. My hair was in a messy bun, I was wearing a large t-shirt that said 'I'm sexy and I know it' on the front and worn jeans. We
                                            were heading out of school, to the parking lot. The afternoon cool breeze met us as soon as we stepped outside. Laura had offered me a ride home, I appreciated it since mom was on duty at the hospital. I updated
                                            Laura with everything, except for Evan. I was not sure why I could not tell her about my online friend. Maybe I was afraid of her thinking I was crazy for talking to a stranger and actually enjoying it. "Yeah,
                                            if you see Shane, let me know. I will run for my life," I said. Laura laughed, snorted and kept on laughing for a while. I smiled at her, at least, there was someone enjoying my tragic life. I scanned the parking
                                            lot. Shane was nowhere to be seen. I frowned. Where was he? "I would have paid anything to see his face," Lau commented passing an arm over my shoulder "you, my friend, are a hero," "A dead hero, Lau," "Oh come
                                            on, what the worst thing he can do?" "I really don't want to find that out," I shook my head. "You'll be fine," she said rubbing my shoulder. On our way home, I was watching through the car's window how the
                                            trees rushed by. I could not stop wondering what Shane was up to. Why would he let me leave school so easily? Was he planning my murder meticulously? Did he plant a bomb in my bag? Did he steal my pencils? What
                                            did he have in mind? I was a hundred percent sure he was not going to let it go so easily. My Iphone buzzed in my bag, I hurried to check it hoping it was message from Evan but to my surprise it was a text.
                                            It was from: Jerkpid. Yeah, I registered Shane's number with that name, a combination of jerk and stupid. Call me childish, but hey, each time I saw it in my contact list. I would grin like an idiot, From: Jerkpid.
                                            Content: You messed with the wrong guy :) I knew he was not going to let this go. I didn't reply, why would I? I really didn't want to know the things he was planning to do to me. Ignorance sometimes was a blessing.
                                            "Jules?" Laura's voice snapped me out of my thoughts. "Huh?" "I was telling you that I visited that page you talk so much about," her eyes were on the road as she spoke. "Wattpad?" "Yeah, it's really cool,"
                                            "I know, I'm addicted to it," "I know that. Do you realize I should be mad at you?" "Why?" I scowled at her. "You never pay attention to me anymore, I feel neglected," she admitted smiling sadly. "Aww, Lau,
                                            you know you're my favorite," "You shouldn't use your phone when I'm telling you something," "I know, I know, sorry," "It's cool," she glanced at me "We're here," Giving her a hug and assuring her I was going
                                            to pay more attention, I got out of her car. My house looked so lonely, I crossed our garden, well, if you could call 'garden' a small tree and dry flowers. Mom didn't have time to water the flowers and I was
                                            too lazy to do it so we pretty much had a flowers' cemetery in the front of our house. Sighing, I opened the front door to find an empty living room. Our house was not fancy or anything like that but it was
                                            comfortable. I went upstairs and entered my room. My curtains were closed so it was pretty dark here. Kicking my shoes off, I took my t-shirt off. "Nice sight," a soft voice whispered. I screamed and jumped
                                            in fear. Holding my chest, I scanned my room. Shane was standing in the darkest corner. His full lips were forming a big smirk "keep going, babe. I'm curious to see the rest of your body," I grasped my t-shirt
                                            from the floor and covered my chest feeling eye-raped. "What the hell are you doing here? How did you get in?" I asked completely shocked. Shane raised his hand and shook some keys. "Your sweet mother trusts
                                            me too much," he replied smugly. My jaw dropped to the floor. mom had given him keys? What the hell? My mother was bipolar, she couldn't stand Jason inside my room but she let Shane be alone with me? "Get out!"
                                            I exclaimed scared. We were alone in my house, we were alone. That phrase kept playing inside my head. I was sure I was starting to freak out. "Oh no, no," Shane shook his head "I'm not going anywhere. You've
                                            been a bad, bad girl, Jules," I didn't like the tone he was using. Fearing for my life, I backed away "and you know what happens to bad girls?" I swallowed and shook my head. "They get punished," his smirk grew
                                            bigger as he stalked towards me. Holy macaronis! I was in deep trouble. X M W L X Holy sweet chocolate cookies! Jules is in trouble, people! Thanks for your support &lt;3 Hugs, Arix *******************************************
                                            [7] Chapter 07 ******************************************* Unedited story! Sorry for grammar mistakes! Thanks for the great support! You rock my world. My Wattpad Love Chapter 07 Fact: Shane was going to kill
                                            me. Curious fact: My socks didn't match. Sad fact: I was going to die a virgin. I could spend all day stating the facts of my life or I could do something while Shane was approaching to me. I scanned my room
                                            searching for something useful to defend myself but after seeing teddy bears, pillows, small lamps, dirty clothes and thin paintings, I realized I had nothing. However, I had the element of surprise that was
                                            the only thing I had. I knew Shane was not expecting what I was about to do. He looked confident and I needed to take advantage of that. In a fast move, I turned on my feet and ran out of the room. "Hey!" Shane
                                            screamed from behind but I was already going downstairs. Holding my t-shirt in one hand, I opened the front door with the other "Jones! Stop!" Shoot, he was close. Shane was taller and faster than me. my chances
                                            of escaping were as low as my IQ but I had to try. I shivered feeling the cold breeze against my partly naked torso. I grimaced in pain while crossing the garden, the dead flowers had somehow become stiff and
                                            sharp. They were scratching my bare feet. Note to self: Water the damn flowers, they may kill me someday "Jones!" I glanced over my shoulder, Shane was sprinting towards me. "You'll never get me alive!" I shouted
                                            as my feet met the cold road's pavement. Why did I have to live in a isolated house? I lived in the middle of nowhere. I had many fights with mom because I wanted to live in the town but of course, she preferred
                                            the 'calmness' of living in a lonely place. Calmness my ass! I was going to get killed and no one would even notice. I ran down the road, the icy wind brushing past my skin. My lower lip quivered, God, I was
                                            cold. Where the hell was the sun when you need it? As in reply, a thunder echoed through the sky. Great, it was going to rain. "Jones!" I didn't bother to look back. I was breathing heavily, my messy bun went
                                            loosed and soon enough my hair was flying backwards with the wind "Stop!" Shane sounded right behind me. God, please help, I'm sorry for not going to church last Sunday. I will go next week I promise. Hearing
                                            Shane's footsteps behind me, I started zigzagging to confuse him. I really needed to stop doing the zigzagging thing because guys, it seriously doesn't work. A warm arm was wrapped around my waist stopping me.
                                            I shrieked trying to get loose. "Let me go!" I said panting. I was out shape, I didn't practice any sport whatsoever. "Jeez! Calm down!" Shane said not sounding as out of breath as I was. Damn football player!
                                            "Help!" I repeated over and over again. Shane covered my mouth with his free hand. "Shut up! Could you please calm down?" he turned me around, holding my arms. My eyes met his, my chest was rising up and down
                                            due to my rapid breathing "What's wrong with you?" he asked frowning "I'm not going to kill you," "Really?" I asked hopeful. "Yeah, I was trying to scare you but I never thought you'd get the run-like-a-crazy-chick
                                            down the road reaction," "I thought... you were..." I slapped his hands and stepped back, "What the hell were you doing in my room, you creep!" I folded my arms across my chest. Shane's gaze dropped to my breasts,
                                            and it was then I remembered I was shirtless. My purple bra was on sight "Ah!" I screamed covering myself with my t-shirt "You are such a pervert!" "Oh please, like I would perv on you," he rolled his eyes "let's
                                            get back inside," he got his hands inside his jeans' pockets and started walking back to the house. I narrowed my eyes at his back. "I'm not going anywhere," I said putting my t-shirt back on. "Then I hope you
                                            enjoy getting wet in the cold," he said getting further away from me. "What?" it took me 15 seconds, three thunders and small drop of rain to understand what he meant. It was going to rain. Sometimes, my brain
                                            surprised me with its slowness. I sprinted towards the house as It started to drizzle. Getting my frozen butt inside the house, I closed the front door behind me. Shane was lying comfortably on the big couch.
                                            He had his hands behind his head. I glared at him. Who the hell did he think he was? "What are you doing here?" he ignored me. I squeezed my fists at my sides "Hey! I'm talking to you!" "What?" He asked looking
                                            bored. "What. Are. You. Doing. Here?" I said each word slowly. Shane stared at me for a moment and then closed his eyes. "I'm thinking of a way to make you pay for what you did," "I didn't do anything," I faked
                                            an innocent tone. Shane sat up, his eyes held a glint of anger. "I'm going to fail Math because of you, Jones," "I told you I was not good with numbers," he stood up. "No, you didn't," "Yes, I did," I retorted
                                            sure. He took a step closer. "No, you didn't. When we finished the assignment the other night, you even patted my shoulder and said and I quote 'You're going to get an A, tiger'" I chuckled. Yeah, I did said
                                            that but I was upset because he had invaded my room rudely and called me an ugly nerd many times. "Hum, I did my best," I shrugged my shoulders. Shane narrowed his hazel eyes at me. "I was trying to impress
                                            this chick in my math class and you ruined it," I rolled my eyes. "You're telling me you caused all this mess because you wanted to get laid?" "Pretty much," I shook my head disapprovingly, "What? She's hot
                                            and has these pair of big boo-" "Shane!" I screamed disgusted. He reminded me so much of Jason. Were all men the same? "Anyway, you know payback is a bi-" "Stop it with the bad words," I cut him off. Shane simply
                                            smirked at me and searched for something behind his back. Was it a gun? A bomb? My pencils? I was definitely not expecting what I saw. "It's curious what we can fin in someone's room," he commented as he showed
                                            me my diary. My jaw dropped to the floor. "Oh no," "Oh yes," he nodded satisfied. "Oh no," I could feel the blood rushing to my face. I was both angry and embarrassed, how could he? "Oh, yes, Jones," I could
                                            tell he was pleased by my reaction, "A diary? Seriously? What are you, ten?" "That's mine! You have no right to see that!" I said with a stomp of my foot. "So, tell me," he started, I could tell he was holding
                                            back laughter "when Jack dumped you because your hair was ugly, did you cry?" Oh no, my hair, that was such a sensitive subject for me. Jack marked me, that happened when I was ten but it still hurt me. My heart
                                            started hammering inside my chest, and my blood was boiling. "Shane," I said through clenched teeth. "You did, didn't you?" he teased smirking. That was it, I don't know how or why but my violent side seemed
                                            to come to the surface when I was around Shane. Clenching my fists, I jumped to him and pushed him hard on the chest. "Give it back, you stupid egocentric jerk!" I kept hitting his chest over and over again.
                                            "Whoa, whoa, calm down, little lion" Shane said not moving at all. He didn't seem to be affected by my hits. I tried reaching my diary but he raised his hand as higher as he could. Being the dwarf I was, I had
                                            no chance of getting it. A brilliant idea came to me, I jumped on the couch and grinned like an idiot when I realized I could reach it now. I grasped the hem of the diary but Shane pulled it backwards. I wasn't
                                            going to let go of my diary, hell no! Shane pulled again and this time I lost my equilibrium and fell forwards. "Ah!" I screamed as I fell, Shane tried to stop me mid-air but he ended up falling with me. "Sh*t!"
                                            he exclaimed when the back of his head hit the floor. I landed on top of him. I got my hands on the floor so I could lean backwards, when I did I froze. We were extremely close. His breath was mixing with mine.
                                            His eyes hazel eyes stared into right mine. My cheeks turned pink when I realized I was straddling him. His hands were on my waist. His wet lips formed a smirk as his gaze dropped to my lips. I could feel my
                                            heart beating fast inside my chest. I'd never been in such intimate position with a guy before. Shane squeezed my waist gently and I bit my lower lip nervously as I gazed at his wet lips. They looked so soft.
                                            "Jules!" Jason's voice snapped me out of my trance. My head snapped towards the source of his voice. He was standing in the front door frame, looking damp. I could see the heavy rain from where I was sitting.
                                            He closed the door and his eyes scanned the living room widening when he spotted me "Oh," was all he said in shock. Quickly, I jumped to my feet smiling nervously. "It's not what it looks like," I explained.
                                            Shane stood up next to me, looking smug and triumphal. Jason stared at me. "Sure, I should go now, I thought you were alone because your mom was on duty but-" "Yes, yes, I am alone," I replied fast. Jason frowned
                                            and glanced at Shane "Shane was about to leave," I said. For a moment, I could only hear the rain and my own breathing. Oh boy, this was awkward. "No, I wasn't," Shane stated sitting on the couch. I sighed in
                                            frustration. Jason and I shared gazes, he was obviously shocked. "Jules, Can I talk you for a sec?" he asked walking to the kitchen. I nodded and followed him. When we were alone, Jason leaned against the kitchen's
                                            counter and folded his arms across his chest. His chestnut straight hair was wet; his fringe was stuck to his forehead. His green eyes were staring at me, waiting for an explanation. "I didn't invite him," I
                                            said frankly. "Am I missing something here? I found you this afternoon in the boy's bathroom with some dude and now this," he shook his head "Next time, I'll find you having se-" "Jason!" "What?" "It was all
                                            a big" I made a circle with my hands "misunderstanding" "Really, Jules? Shane Mason? I thought you wouldn't go for the school's jerk," "And you're right, I wouldn't," Jason gave me the 'I don't believe you at
                                            all' look. "When I saw you two, it looked like you were going to devour each other," he accused. "No," I grimaced "I was trying to get my diary back, that was all," I said showing him my diary. Jason opened
                                            his mouth in shock. "You have a diary?" he burst out laughing. I narrowed my eyes at him. "Yes, I have a diary," I said trying to maintain my dignity. "That's like..." he clutched his stomach laughing "so girly,"
                                            "I am a girl, Jason," "Yeah, but I never thought you would be that girly," "There's nothing wrong with having a diary," I defended holding my diary against my chest. "Whatever you say, Jules," Jason said walking
                                            to the fridge. He took a peach out and gave it a bite. Peach... Peachy girl... Evan... I ran out of the kitchen and went upstairs. I heard Shane yelling from the living room but ignored him. I entered my room
                                            and sat on my bed. opening my laptop, I logged on wattpad. I had three private messages. I smiled like a fool when I saw there was one from Evan. Him: Did you get killed? ;) Me: Unfortunately for you, no. Him:
                                            That's too bad. Me: I'm still in danger though. Him: Why? Me: Shane is here. Him: Here where? Me: My house. Him: Oh Me: Yeah, but I'm fine. Him: Missed me, girly? ;) Me: Pftt, never. We chatted for a while.
                                            It surprised me how many things we had in common. Even though, Evan and I were clearly opposites we still liked the same bands, food and books. It was kind of contradictory if you ask me. Shane and Jason didn't
                                            appear in my room. I wondered what they were doing downstairs but there was no way I was getting my butt out of bed any time soon. As I waited for Evan's reply to one of my private messages, I scanned his wattpad
                                            profile. My eyes roamed down his message board and I frowned. There was a public conversation between him and a girl. Her: Oh please, I would never fall for you. him: I think you already fell, silly girl. My
                                            heart sank in my chest. They were flirting... I read the rest of the messages to confirm they were shamelessly flirting. Sadness and disappointment invaded me. I knew I was being irrational, I didn't even know
                                            the guy but somehow, I'd felt special when Evan talked to me. I'd felt like I was the only one he wanted to speak to when he was on wattpad. Obviously, I was wrong. I ran my hand through my hair and clicked
                                            on the private messages option. Evan was telling something about some rock band he liked. I kept giving him short replies like "Yeah" "Ok" "Right" until he noticed my change of mood. Him: Something wrong? Me:
                                            No. Him: Spit it out. Me: What? Him: You're obviously upset about something. Me: I'm fine. Him: Then why the change of mood? Me: I said I'm fine. Him: Tell me. Me: :) I'm fine. So, you like a girl on here, huh?
                                            I tried to seem casual but I sucked at pretending. Him: What do you mean? Me: Don't play the fool, haha I can help you with her if you want. Him: ??? Me: The girl on your message board :P Him: You're jealous?
                                            Me: Pfftt no! Him: Yes, you are. Me: No, I am not. Him: Right, prove it. Me: How? Him: Help me with her :) (Even though, I don't need your help to get a girl) Me: Hum, I don't know her. Him: Neither do I, but
                                            she looks hot in her profile pic. My stomach clenched at his words. What was wrong with me? Was I jealous? Me: Sure, I'll help you. I pressed the enter button reluctantly. Him: You are so silly, Jules. Me: Why?
                                            Him: Never mind. Me: Evan, can I ask you something? Him: Yeah. Me: Where are you from? Him: haha Stalker. Me: Please, I want to know. Him: Why? Me: I don't know. Him: Give me your house phone's number :) Me:
                                            What? Him: Do it :) I typed the number, my heart was hammering inside my chest. What was he up to? Me: Evan? He didn't reply. I jumped when the house's phone started ringing. It couldn't be him... right? X M
                                            W L X Yeah yeah cliffhanger. Get your tomatoes, carrots,cucumbers, whatever you want to throw at me (Not potatoes please, I hate those) Also, shoot me with your comments. They make my day, you guys are so creative
                                            :D Love, Arix ******************************************* [8] Chapter 08 ******************************************* One, thanks for the amazing support! Two, sorry for grammar mistakes! This story is unedited
                                            so, yeah, sorry in advance! Three, I love you, guys &lt;3 You're so cool! My Wattpad Love Chapter 08 I was frozen. I couldn't move at all, my eyes moved away from my laptop's screen and landed on my room's door.
                                            The phone was ringing... The house's phone... I'd just given Evan my number. Was he calling? Panic rose in me when I remembered my house's phone was downstairs and Shane was there. I jumped out of bed and ran
                                            out of my room into the hallway. I found Jason on the way. He was obviously heading to my room, "Hey, I'm gonna use your bathroom because-" I ran past him and went downstairs "Jules?" Jason's confused voice
                                            was soon left behind as I clumsily moved down the stairs. My feet met the warm living room's carpet and I stopped on my tracks. Shane was standing next to the couch; he had the phone pressed against his left
                                            ear. His gaze met mine as he proceeded to speak, "Yes, she is here, hold on," Shane offered me the phone. I stopped breathing, "Who is it?" I said in a low tone. Shane shrugged his shoulders. Swallowing my nervousness,
                                            I grasped the phone and held it close to my ear. My heart was hammering inside my chest. "Hello?" I greeted squeezing the phone cord with my free hand. I could hear the person's breathing at the other side of
                                            the line "Hello?" I repeated a little bit louder this time. Come on, Evan, Say something. "Hello?" My throat was dry. Why was I so nervous? Why wasn't he speaking? It had to be him, I knew it was him. The line
                                            went dead and I let out a breath I didn't know I was holding. Putting the phone back in place, I ran my fingers through my hair. Why didn't he say anything? I was confused. "Who was that?" Shane's voice snapped
                                            me out of my trance. "Hum, a friend," I replied automatically. My mind was still on those seconds. Hearing his breathing had actually made him more real for me. I didn't know how to explain it but it just did.
                                            "You look like you're going to have a heart attack," Shane commented lying comfortable on the couch. It was then I noticed the TV was on, he was watching some football game, how predictable. "I..." I trailed
                                            off as my eyes landed on the phone again. "Are you on drugs?" Shane asked casually while chewing something. It sounded like chips... Like ruffles. I snapped my head towards him. For a moment, I completely forgot
                                            about Evan. Anger filled my veins when I spotted the ruffles bag on Shane's lap. "Are you eating my ruffles?" I asked dangerously. Shane kept his eyes on the TV and got another chip in his mouth as a reply.
                                            I leaned over the couch and snatched the bag away from him. "Hey!" He complained looking at me. I held the ruffles against my chest. "This is not your house! Stop lazing around and eating my snacks," Shane stood
                                            up, his full height intimidated me. I took a step backwards. "You shouldn't bother a man when he's watching a football game," his tone held a bit of threat. I narrowed my eyes at him. "You shouldn't eat a girl's
                                            snack," I retorted "it's dangerous," "Really?" He cocked an eyebrow. "Yeah, really," I was having a hard time trying to maintain my strong pose. Shane was not only taller and stronger than me, he was also devilish.
                                            He had that bad boy look that girls always fell for. Luckily, I was not one of them. Shane kept walking towards me like a predator. I squeezed the bag in fear and heard the crunch of the chips. Oh my poor chips!
                                            "Give me that," he ordered. I shook my head "Jones..." he sounded dangerous. My back hit the wall and I knew I was trapped. "Stay back," he titled his head to the side. His full lips formed a smirk. "I'm missing
                                            the game because of you; you better give me those chips back, Jones," "My name is Julie. Stop calling me by my last name," I said trying to distract him. I needed to find a way to escape, me and my chips needed
                                            a plan to get away from Mr. Jerkpid. "I will call you whatever I want to call you, you know why?" he continued before I could say something "because you messed with me. You ruined my chance of getting laid tonight
                                            so I will make sure to ruin your night as well," "I didn't-" The house's phone rang again. Shane and I shared gazes for a second. I wanted to run to the phone but Shane was on my way. "If you want to answer
                                            the phone, give me the chips," he traded folding his arms across his chest. There was no way I could go through him, he would stop me in a blink of an eyes. The phone rang again. The suspense was killing me,
                                            was it Evan? Was he calling again? I, Julie Jones, was put on the most difficult situation of my life. I had a choice to make, I looked down at my ruffles. I knew they were inside the bag, I knew they were crispy
                                            and salty. How I loved those chips! But I also knew I had to let them go if I wanted to pick up that phone. Chips or Evan... It was a tough decision. Yeah, I know you're judging me for actually wavering about
                                            it but hey, Ruffles were my life. After the third ring of the phone, I sighed in defeat and whispered 'Sorry' to my chips. I threw the bag to Shane; he caught it in mid air and grinned. Getting him out of the
                                            way, I answered the phone. "Hello?" "Jules?" "Mom?" I asked in disbelief. "Hey, sweetie, how is everything? Did you have dinner? It's in the microwave," Arg! I had sacrificed my chips for nothing?! "Arg, mom!"
                                            "What?" "My chips," I growled glancing at Shane. He was back on the couch staring intently at the TV. That stupid chips' killer! "Chips? Julie, you can't have chips for dinner," mom said in a motherly tone.
                                            "I know, I was just..." I trailed off as I remembered something "mom, why is Shane in our house?" I said in a whisper. Hopefully, with the loud noise coming from the TV Shane wouldn't hear me. "Oh, I figured
                                            you would need some company since I'm on duty," "Why Shane, mom?" "I trust him," she said frankly. "Why would you trust him? He's an arrogant jerk," "Language, Jules!" "Sorry, but still I don't want him around,"
                                            "He is a nice young boy, Julie," I looked at him for a moment. He was eating my chips like a pig. "You are blind, mom," "No, I'm not. Just give him a chance," "Why would I-" "I promise he is a nice boy behind
                                            that arrogant facade, sweetie. Trust me," I sighed in frustration. "Fine, but I won't clean his mess," I said glancing at the chips lying on the carpet. I held my chest; those chips were like fallen soldiers
                                            in a battle. Shane was going to pay for that. "I gotta go, take care, darling. If you need anything, give me a call," "I will," "Where is your dinner?" she asked. She was testing me to see if I'd paid attention.
                                            "In the microwave," "Good, good, have a nice night, sweet heart," "You too, mom" I hung up. Ignoring the Jerkpid on the couch, I went upstairs. Mostly, because I was peeing but also cause I needed to check if
                                            Evan had messaged me again. I knew he had called me, but why didn't he say a word? I slammed the bathroom's door opened and screamed at the top of my lungs. Jason was standing next to the shower. He was naked.
                                            I gasped when my eyes met his little buddy. "Oh my God!" I repeated over and over again. When did I forget Jason was in the house? "Jesus, Jules!" Jason exclaimed covering his private parts with both hands.
                                            "Oh my God!" I covered my eyes and gave my back to him "I'm so sorry!" What was wrong with me? Was it my new hobby to see everyone's little buddy? I closed the door behind me. I was sure I was as red as tomato.
                                            I couldn't remove that scene from my mind. I was so embarrassed. I saw Jason naked. I saw my best friend naked. Those thoughts wouldn't stop prowling around my mind, not to mention the image of his little buddy.
                                            The harder I tried to forget it, the quickest It displayed inside my head. I entered my room, locking the door behind me. I could feel the blood in my face. I needed some time to think. Hell, I needed time to
                                            stop looking like a freaking strawberry. Strawberry. Evan... God, were all those fruits going to remind me of him all the time? It was kind of weird, if you ask me. Regaining my regular breathing, I sat on my
                                            bed and checked my laptop. I had no new messages from Evan. I checked my chat box and noticed he was online but he hadn't message me. I started typing a message, Me: You there? Him: No Me: -.- Him: ;) Me: Did
                                            you call me? Him: No. Me: I know it was you. Why didn't you speak? Him: I don't know what you're talking about. Me: You're lying. Him: Am I? Me: Evan... Him: Yes, Jules? I don't know why but I felt strange -in
                                            a good way- each time he wrote my name. Me: Please, stop lying. Him: I'm not lying. Me: Come on, I gave you my house number which was kind of dangerous since I barely know you. You don't want to tell me anything
                                            about you. Him: I have told you lots of things about me already, Jules. Me: I mean, personal stuff, I don't even know where you live. Him: Why do you want to know? Me: Because we are wattpad friends. Him: Wattpad
                                            friends? Me: Yeah Him: Is that a new term? Me: Sort of, I made it up. Him: You are weird. How come you consider me your friend now, I thought you hated me. Me: Hum, I don't hate you. Him: Right, I forgot you're
                                            Mrs. Strawberry. You're incapable of hating someone. I narrowed my eyes at the screen. Me: Again with the nicknames? Him: They suit you ;) Me: You're changing the subject. Him: Whatever you say, peachy girl.
                                            Me: Evan... Him: Yeah? Me: Stop avoiding the question and tell me, why didn't you say a word? Him: I didn't have to. I got a funny feeling in my stomach. So he was admitting he'd called me. My heart started
                                            hammering inside my chest. I didn't know what to say. I started typing a short reply when he messaged me again. Him: You have a sweet voice :) That was it. My heart was going to jump out of my chest. What was
                                            wrong with me? Somehow, knowing that he'd been at the other side of the line made me feel nervous. Me: Thank you? Him: No problem. It was the first time Evan complimented me. It was so weird that I had no idea
                                            of what to say. Me: Why didn't you say something? Him: you wanted to hear my voice, didn't you? Me: Well, yeah. Him: Why? Me: Curiosity. Him: ;) Me: It's not fair. You got to hear my voice but I didn't hear
                                            yours. Him: Does it matter? Me: Of course, it does. Him: I have to go. Me: Evan! He logged off and I let out a groan of frustration. Lazily, I got out of bed and headed out of the room. I still needed to pee
                                            but there was no way I was getting closer to the bathroom again. I could hear the shower so Jason was probably still inside. I shuddered remembering the awkward moment from before. Why did I have to see him
                                            naked? Shaking that memory out of my head, I --for the third time in less than three hours-- went downstairs. Shane was no longer watching TV. He had his earphones on and his eyes were closed. The empty bag
                                            of ruffles was resting on his lap. His longs legs were extended; his feet were resting on the coffee table. If my mother saw him, I was sure she would kill him in cold blood. Rule number one in the Jones House:
                                            Never mess with the furniture; you'll die a horrible death if you do. For a moment, I dared to stare at him. The muscles of his arms and shoulders were relaxed. You could tell he was defined through his black
                                            t-shirt. His face was flawless, his skin looked creamy, no sign of acne or any puberty mark. His lips were full, his upper lip had two defined curves. It resembled the top part of a heart. His eyebrows were
                                            kind of blond and perfectly placed above his eyes. His blond brownish hair were messy but in a good way unlike mine, I was sure my hair looked like a devastated bird's nest. It was then I heard his voice, Shane
                                            was singing? Well, more like humming a song, I focused on listening. "Something's getting in the way. Something's just about to break. I will try to find my place in the diary of Jane" I recognized that song.
                                            It was "Diary of Jane" by Breaking Benjamin. I never thought Shane would like rock music. He looked so innocent with his eyes closed. To think behind that innocent cute face, there was an evil arrogant jerk.
                                            Suddenly, he opened his eyes. Shoot! I got caught staring! His hazel eyes stared into my blue ones paralyzing me. He didn't say anything; we just stared into each other's eyes in silence. For a moment, I felt
                                            like he was not that evil, that mom was right and there was actually a good guy hiding behind that player arrogant facade but then he spoke and ruined it, "You like what you see, fake nerd?" he gave me a smug
                                            smile. I rolled my eyes. "Not really," he took his earphones off. "Then stop checking me out," he said casually "it's creeping me out," "I was not checking you out," "Yes, you were. I can't blame you though,
                                            I'm ridiculously hot," I narrowed my eyes at him. "How can you survive with that ego? It shocks me, really," "To be a girl, you really don't care about your looks, do you?" he scanned my body shaking his head,
                                            "You seriously look like a boy," Shane really knew how to get on my nerves. "You are-" the phone rang and I picked it up quickly "Hello?" there was silence "Evan?" there was no answer. Shane put his earphones
                                            back on and closed his eyes. I gave my back to him "Evan, say something, I know it's you," "Hey," I stopped breathing. My whole world stopped with there. Time slowed down and I held my chest. his voice was so...
                                            sexy. My heart was racing full speed. "I-I-I" I stuttered. I heard him chuckle. "Goodnight, sweet Jules," his husky yet velvety voice whispered and then he hung up. Even tough, I knew he'd hung up I was still
                                            pressing the phone against my ear. I was shocked, I never expected him to call me again. I never expected him to hear his voice. I let out a breath I didn't know I was holding. I closed my eyes realizing one
                                            thing: God, I loved his voice. X M W L X That's the end of the chapter! Muahaha, see, I didn't end it on a cliffhanger so stop throwing potatoes at me, you mean people! Hugs and yellow carrots, Arix :D *******************************************

                                            right by TheHandsomeBeast &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Enjoy! xx My Wattpad Love Chapter 09 I was writhing around my bed frustrated. I was trying to get some sleep. For the past hour, I'd been failing miserably. I couldn't
                                            get Evan's sexy voice out of my head. What was wrong with me? He'd only said a few words, why was I already dying to hear his voice again? As soon as he'd hung up, I'd headed to my room to check my computer.
                                            He was offline in wattpad so I waited... I chatted with other friends from the site while I waited for him to come online but he never came. I had no choice but to sleep, it was school's night and it was past
                                            midnight. But of course, thanks to my unhealthy sleeping habits, I was lying on my back with my eyes wide opened. Groaning in frustration, I sat up rubbing my face. My stomach roared loudly, I hadn't even tasted
                                            the so famous dinner Mom left for me in the microwave. I swung my feet out of bed and slowly got up. I made my way to the door wondering what Shane was doing. I had left him on the couch after throwing him some
                                            covers. I didn't like him but that didn't mean I was going to let him freeze to death in my living room. I was crossing the hallway when I passed the bathroom's door. Instantly, an image of a naked Jason played
                                            in front of my eyes. God, was I ever going to be able to erase that from my memory? I wished my mind was like a computer, that I could delete all the awkward, unnecessary memories with a click. Fortunately,
                                            Jason had left as soon as he finished the shower. I guessed he wasn't ready to deal with the awkwardness of the situation. I mean, I saw him naked. I went downstairs walking as slow as possible. I resembled
                                            a zombie during night. The lack of sleep was killing my brain cells in a slow but steady process. When I reached the living room, Shane was lying across the couch in front of the stairs. He was using his phone
                                            and listening to music. The TV was off so the entire place was semi-dark. Shane looked at me; an amused smile appeared on his face. "If you're going to seduce me, you should try something better than a little
                                            mermaid pajama," he suggested and chuckled. "Whatever," I stated entering the kitchen. I knew my pajamas were not sexy at all but hey, I was in my house. I could wear anything I wanted, he was the intruder not
                                            me. How the hell did that jerk end up staying over my house anyway? Oh yeah, I had a very gullible mother. She was the one to blame if I got killed tonight. Opening the microwave, I heard his footsteps from
                                            behind but ignored him. "Are you looking for your broomstick, little witch?" I ignored him. Did he have fun telling me how ugly I look? Yeah, definitely yes "Aww, Jones is not really chatty tonight, isn't she?"
                                            "Ah, shut up already!" I exclaimed and my eyes widened when I saw the microwave was empty. What the... Immediately, I turned on my feet and pointed my finger accusingly to the tall guy sitting across the counter
                                            "You ate my dinner?" I asked knowing he was the only one in the house. I didn't need to be bright to know he was the culprit. "Yeah, I thought you were going to eat that so," he shrugged his shoulders. "It was
                                            MY dinner! You are such a... Arg!" I slammed the microwave's little door closed. Shane looked surprised by my outburst. "Calm down, little lion," What's up with him and using 'little' for every nickname he gave
                                            me? I knew he was significantly taller than me but he didn't need to remind me of it all day. Opening the fridge angrily, I searched for something to eat. After seeing all the tasteless food my mother called
                                            'healthy food' I slammed the fridge closed as well. I needed to calm down, it was not my electro domestics' fault there was a jerk in the house. I turned to Shane again and for a moment, I saw a flash of guilt
                                            cross his face, "What are you doing here, Shane?" I asked bitterly "I know I messed your chances of getting laid tonight but don't you think you're taking this too far?" he opened his mouth to say something
                                            but I continued "I mean, you are in my house, eating my food, invading my personal life. That is just too much," "It wasn't like I planned this, alright?" he explained sounding annoyed "Your mother called me
                                            this afternoon, she asked me to stay over because you were going to be alone," "Why would she do that?" I asked in disbelief. "Because she trusts me," was his reply. I knew he was being honest, Mom definitely
                                            trusted him otherwise I was sure she wouldn't leave two teenagers alone in a house. Sighing in frustration and defeat, I took a bag of chips out of the cabinets and sat across Shane. I had no energy whatsoever
                                            to keep arguing with him. "Why are you awake?" I wondered while chewing loudly my chips. They weren't ruffles but they were better than all those stuff Mom had in the fridge. "Couldn't sleep," he said casually
                                            "You?" "Same," reluctantly, I offered him the bag so he could have some chips. I don't know where my anger had gone but I didn't care. I felt good to have something in my stomach. Shane shook his head. "I'm
                                            full," I narrowed my eyes at him. Of course he was full, he had eaten MY dinner. Breathe, Jules, breathe There was a long moment of silence. Shane was staring at me with... curiosity? We locked gazes and It
                                            suddenly became difficult to swallow my chips. His hazel eyes were so deep, like they had life on their own. Shane was really hot but it was not just his physical appearance, which was very fine. Everything
                                            about him screamed danger. But that kind of danger, we always want to taste. His bed hair made him look even sexier than usual. I shut my thoughts. I couldn't be interested in him. He was an arrogant jerk but
                                            I couldn't deny he was as attractive as a huge bad of Ruffles. Ok, maybe that was a bad comparison but you would understand if you knew the amount of passion I had for Ruffles. "You're done checking me out?"
                                            he asked smirking at me. I looked away blushing. "Psst, I wasn't checking you out," I lied. I was suddenly self-conscious of my outfit. I was sure I looked terrible; I didn't even want to imagine how my hair
                                            looked. My hair... "Are you blushing?" Shane was snickering. I glared at him from the corner of my eye and got on my feet. For some reason, I felt nervous now. "I should sleep," I mumbled as I walked to the
                                            door fro that would lead me to the living room. Shane jumped to his feet and blocked my way. I had to tilt my head back to look at his face, "move," I ordered but he remained motionless. His intense gaze was
                                            making me feel weird. He was too close for my like so I stepped back until the small of my back hit the counter. Shane moved with me, "what are you doing? Back off," I demanded as he rested both of his hands
                                            on the counter behind me, his arms trapping me. I could smell his nice manly cologne. "You know, you ruined my plans of getting laid tonight," he whispered, his minty breath hitting my face "You owe me," "I
                                            don't owe you anything, back off," I pushed his chest but he didn't budge. "Am I making you nervous, Jules?" my stomach did a back flip. It was the first time he called me by my name. My heart started racing
                                            inside my small ribcage. "No," I knew he was playing with me. I could tell by the amused expression on his face. I dropped my gaze to his chest, which was a mistake; I was now looking at his defined chest and
                                            abdomen. I could see he muscles beneath his t-shirt. "You like what you see?" he stated arrogantly, I pushed his chest hard this time, "Go on, babe, I like it rough," I scrunched my nose in disgust at his remark.
                                            "Leave me alone, stop," I could feel my heated cheeks. Pervert comments always made me blush. "Look at me," "Shane, stop it, let me go," I felt the urge to punch his chest again but I didn't want another sexual
                                            remark so I stayed still. "Look at me, Jules," I looked up to meet his eyes. They held a glint of something I couldn't decipher. His eyes landed on my lips. My breath was heavy, my lips parted in anticipation.
                                            He leaned closer until our breaths were mixing. But then, he smirked and took a step backwards "Sorry, you just don't do it for me," my heart sank in my chest. His words hurt my woman pride, but I managed not
                                            to let it show. "Right," I walked past him and went upstairs. Why did it hurt so bad? I guess, my pride was hurt. It was not nice to have a guy to say those words to you. After some minutes of struggling, I
                                            finally fell asleep. *** The week rushed by uneventful. It was the same routine: going to school, hanging out with Laura, avoiding Shane and been avoided by Jason. I really didn't get why Jason was not even
                                            talking to me. I mean, I know it was awkward after the 'incident' in the bathroom but I believed I was the worst affected in this situation. I saw his little buddy for God sakes! That image was going to hunt
                                            me until the end of time. As for Evan, I talked to him every day. He was being friendlier to me but he was still arrogant and insulted me once in a while. I was used to it though, which was kind of worrying,
                                            a girl should never get used to be insulted, right? However, his insults were harmless. I mean, being called Mrs. Strawberry or Cheesy writer weren't considered insults, were they? Anyway, the week end was here.
                                            It was Saturday morning. I was, of course, doing homework and studying, yeah right, I was actually watching TV with no intention of getting my butt out of the couch anytime soon. Yes, I was lazy, sue me. I was
                                            waiting for Evan to message me back whilst watching Friends. I freaking loved that TV show. It was hilarious. My phone buzzed and I checked it knowing it was him. How did I know? That was one of the mysteries
                                            of life. Him: Morning, sleepyhead. Me: Sleepyhead? Him: Yeah ;) What's up? Me: Just chilling, watching TV, you? Him: Same, shouldn't you be studying Math? Me: Hum, yeah, it is a waste of time though. Him: how
                                            can you expect understanding Math if you never study? Me: I have tried but it's hard. He didn't reply for a while. I realized how bad I wanted him to call me again. That urge was growing in me since that night
                                            he'd called me. Since the moment I heard his sexy husky voice. I would call him if I could but I didn't have his number. Gaining some strenght, I dared to type something Me: I was wondering... I sent the message
                                            without finishing it. Ah! Stupid Jules! Him: You wanted me to call you again, don't you? My heart started hammering inside my chest. How did he know? Me: Yeah, how do you know? He didn't reply and my house phone
                                            rang making me jump in the couch. I held my chest, my breathing became uneven. I could feel the loud beats of my heart in my throat and ears. What was wrong with me? I squeezed my sweaty hands. He was calling
                                            me. Evan was calling me. Jesus, I was going to die of an heart attack. Calm down, Jules, Breathe I chanted inside my head. The suspense was killing me. I grasped the phone and pressed to my ear wit a shaking
                                            hand. "He-Hello," I stammered feeling stupid. "Hello, Jules," his sexy voice sent a shiver through my spine. My legs weakened. "Hum, Hi," I swallowed. My throat was dry. "You sound nervous," he said amused.
                                            "Hum, no, I was just... the phone was far away so," I bit my lower lip "I ran to get it, I'm..." "stop lying," he said in a whisper "I know I make you nervous," "No, it-" "Why did you want me to call you?" To
                                            hear your amazing sexy voice... and drool over my phone. I couldn't tell him that so I went for the lie. "I was bored," "Really?" I swear, I could tell he was smirking at the other side of line. How did I know?
                                            Add that to the big list of mysteries of life. "Yeah, so, what are you doing?" I desperately needed to change the subject. For the sake of my heart and lungs, I needed to calm down. "I think that is pretty obvious.
                                            I'm talking to you," he said teasingly. I rolled my eyes. "I mean... besides that," "Nothing, I was reading," he paused, "I was reading your story," My stomach twisted in nervousness. I could feel tingles inside.
                                            "You were?" "Yes, it made me curious," "Why?" I sat on the armrest of the couch; my legs would give up anytime. Jeez, how did his voice affect me this much? "The last chapters were written with so much passion,"
                                            he commented "do you like someone, Jules?" My heart skipped a beat. I clang to the phone for dear life. "I-I..." I stuttered not knowing what to reply. Did I like someone? He was asking the question I'd been
                                            avoiding for a while now. I was deeply afraid of the answer. x M W L X YES! YES! YES! It's a cliffhanger!! Shoot me potatoes, kill me, cut me in pieces! You have the right to do so, but remember, if you hurt
                                            the writer, there'll be no story! Muahaha you're trapped! Next chapter will be revealing :D and it'll be longer. Hugs and purple tomatoes, Arix ;) ******************************************* [10] Chapter 10
                                            ******************************************* My Wattpad Love Chapter 10 I was stupid, really really stupid. I was stuttering, uttering incoherent sentences and laughing nervously. Evan's question had definitely
                                            caught me out of guard. I didn't know what to answer so I did the stupidest thing I'd ever done in my life. And believe me, I'd done many. I hung up. I held my chest trying to calm my breathing. I stared at
                                            the phone in shock. Why did I do that? what the hell was wrong with me? I covered my face and growled in anger. I was angry at myself for being so stupid. How could I do that? It was beyond to rude to hang up
                                            like that. What was he going to think of me now? In my defense, I panicked. It was like a reflex movement, besides, I wasn't saying much. I was only embarrassing myself by stuttering and mumbling unfinished
                                            sentences. His question kept replaying inside my head. Did I like someone? Why was I so afraid of the answer? Sure I could forget about it and pretended nothing happened but there was no point of fooling myself.
                                            Because I, Julie Ann Jones, sort of liked someone. I furrowed my eyebrows as I realized this. Evan... I definitely felt attracted to him. Yes, call me crazy. I know it was crazy. I mean, I hadn't even seen the
                                            guy. I had no idea of what he looked like but somehow that didn't matter. I had fun talking to him. I even enjoyed arguing with him, which was pretty often by the way. he made butterflies appear in my stomach.
                                            Not to mention how nervous I became when I heard his voice. I didn't want to imagine what would happen to me if I see him. I would probably die of a respiratory arrest, which would be a very lame death. Sighing
                                            I fell backwards on my couch. How did I end up liking him? I was sure I hated him at the beginning. He insulted me for God sakes! He made a rude comment about my story. I remembered that as clear as water. I
                                            ran my fingers through my hair. Maybe, I was a masochist. The phone ran making me jump. I stared at it in silence, I didn't move for a while. But then I realized my stare was not going to stop the phone from
                                            ringing so I extended my shaking hand slowly towards it. What if it was Evan? What if it was the Ruffles' factory manager to tell me they were not going to make any more Ruffles? I swallowed, terrified by both
                                            options. "Hello?" I answered trying to keep a straight voice. "Jules!" I relaxed as I heard Laura's voice. Ruffles were safe. "Hey, Lau, what's up?" "What's up?!" she imitated my voice. It was then I noticed
                                            she sounded angry "why are you ignoring me on facebook?" "What?" "Great, now you're deaf," "What are you talking about?" "You're online on face book and you keep ignoring my messages," she explained. "I do?"
                                            I frowned and then spotted my opened laptop on the couch "Oh, i was... yeah, I was online but I was not on the computer," "Really?" she asked sarcastically. "Stop it with the attitude, Lau. I was.... busy,"
                                            I finished unsure. "You're telling me you are busy in a Saturday's morning?" she asked skeptically. "Yeah, I was..." Think of something, Jules. I encouraged myself "I was peeing," Really? That was the best excuse
                                            I could come up with? "I've been peeing a lot," I further explained. Great move, Jules. "Right," Lau sounded uncomfortable. I was not good at lying, I usually got verbal diarrhea whenever I was trying to lie.
                                            "Yeah, there's something wrong with my bladder," God, I really knew how to extend my misery. "Hum, okay," Just shut up! Stop talking about your bladder! "Maybe, I drank too much water. My bladder is probably
                                            small," "Oh God! Shut up, Jules! You suck at lying, Jesus!" Laura exclaimed and then laughed. I couldn't help joining her laughter. I had managed to talk more than two minutes about my bladder. "Sorry," I said
                                            after laughing my ass off. "It's cool. Anyway, what I was trying to tell you on face book was that I think I like someone at school," "Really?" I was shocked. Laura had not been lucky with guys. Her last boyfriend
                                            dumped her for some transferring student from Jamaica. After that she swore not to trust any other man. I couldn't blame her, she'd been hurt a lot of times. "Yeah, he is way out of my league, but I think you
                                            could help me out," "Who is it?" "Jordan," she whispered secretly. "Jordan? Shane's best friend?" I asked in disbelief. Laura giggled. "Yeah," "Are you on drugs?" "Jules.." "He is an arrogant douche, just like
                                            Shane. It doesn't surprise me they're best friends," "I know he's a player," Laura admitted "but I think he has a side no one knows about. He's in my art class, and he is very passionate about it. He loves painting
                                            and his eyes turned so bright when he speaks of art. He looks so sweet," "He is a player, Lau," "I know," "Then why are we even having this conversation? Just stay away from him," yeah, i was being overprotective
                                            but hey, she was my best friend. I didn't want her to get hurt. I'd watched her cry over men many times. I'd eaten ice cream and watched romance movies as she sobbed snuggling to me. I'd been with her in every
                                            time she'd got her heart broken. I didn't want her to go through that again. "I'm just saying I like him, I'm not in love with him or anything like that," "Then stop liking him," Laura sighed. "It's not that
                                            easy," "Try," "It is useless. Every time I see him..." she paused and I swear I could imagine the dreamy face she was making. "I don't even know why you tell me this, you're not even listening to me," I spoke
                                            defeated. "You're my best friend, who else am I going to share these stuff with?" Instantly, I felt guilty. I hadn't tld her anything about Evan. should I? But what was I going to say? 'Hey, Lau, I liked this
                                            guy I met on the internet a few weeks ago. I hadn't even seen him' It didn't sound reasonable for me to tell her that. After chatting about random stuff, she hung up. She was going to her dancing class. Laura
                                            loved dancing. I, on the other hand, hated it. I just sucked at it. I couldn't dance to save my life. Grasping my laptop, I swallowed getting ready to deal with Evan. I checked my wattpad chat box. He was online
                                            but he hadn't written anything to me. Was he mad at me? It was understandable, I would be mad at him. I mean, I'd abruptly hung up. Nervously, I sent him a message. Me: You there? He took a few minutes to reply.
                                            I was growing more and more nervous. Him: Yeah. Me: Sorry about before. Him: You mean, you're sorry for hanging up on me? Me: Yeah, I was just... Peeing? I couldn't make the same mistake twice. I was not that
                                            stupid. I retyped my message, Me: I was just feeding my cat. Him: I thought you were allergic to cats. I was indeed, when did I tell him that? My memory was not really good. Me: Hum, I wear gloves around it.
                                            Really, Jules, really? Him: You're telling you have a cat even though you're allergic and you feed it wearing gloves? me: Yeah. I was pathetic. Him: You really can't lie, can you? I sighed defeated. Me: Nope,
                                            sorry, I was surprised by your question. Him: Why? Me: Why did you ask me that? Him: I told you I was curious. Me: Why? Him: Your story got me thinking about it. You wrote it like you knew how it feels to like
                                            someone. Me: Everyone knows that. Him: Sure but writers know about what they write. You seem to have experienced what you were writing. Me: Hum, okay. Him: Okay? Let's make a deal. I narrowed my eyes at the
                                            screen. Me: What deal? Him: I'll forgive you for hanging up on me if you answer the question. Me: What question? Him: Do you like someone? i couldn't help the funny feeling in my stomach when I read the question
                                            again. I could still hear his sexy voice saying those words when he asked me that over the phone. Me: I'll answer if you answer one of my questions. There were many things I'd asked him and he hadn't bothered
                                            replying. Him: Deal. Me: Yes, I like someone. Him: ;) Who is it? Me: No, that's another question. Now, it's my turn. How old are you? Him: I'm older than you. Me: not enough, I want a digit. Him: 19 ;) He was
                                            two years older than me. That wasn't much, considering I was getting closer to my eighteen birthday. Me: Cool. Him: So, who is it? Me: Drop it. I'm not telling you. Him: I'll tell you where I live if you tell
                                            who you like. That was such a tempting offer. But there was no way I was telling him he was the one I liked. Me: So what are you doing? Him: nice try. Why can't you tell me? It's not like I'll know the person
                                            you like. Me: That's personal stuff. I don't want to say it, okay? Him: Why are you making such a big deal of this? Me: Why can't you just drop it? Him: I'm just intrigued by your secretiveness. Me: Evan, let
                                            it go, Him: Fine, whatever. Me: Are you mad at me? Him: Nah, you should study Math. I'll see you around. His curt goodbye confirmed my suspects: He was upset. He was still online but he was not talking to me.
                                            I spend some time watching YouTube videos but got bored pretty quickly. It was eating me from the insides to know he was online and not talking to me. Sighing in defeat, I went to his profile ad my heart sank
                                            in my chest. He was talking to the same girl from the other day. All their messages were on his message's board. They were flirting shamelessly. I was hurt, not only because I was jealous but because he had
                                            stopped chatting with me to talk to her. It was like he was choosing her over me. God, I had to stop being so dramatic. He was some guy I met on wattpad. I looked down notcing the tears filling my eyes. Seriously,
                                            Jules? You're going to cry over some guy you haven't even seen? I held back tears and opened Evan's chat box. Me: You didn't need to ditch me to flirt with that girl. I sent the message and instantly regretted
                                            it. What was wrong with me? Me: I mean, I could have given you some tips to make her fall for you. I sent that second message in a pathetic attempt of fixing it. He didn't reply and that made me feel worse.
                                            I could see him replying to the girl on his message board so he was obviously there ignoring me. Evan was ignoring me and it hurt. I slammed my laptop closed. I needed t get some fresh air. I needed someone
                                            to talk to. I changed into a pair of jeans and a purple t-shirt that matched my purple converse. I combed my hair with my fingers and then searched for my phone. I called Jason but he didn't pick up. Was he
                                            still avoiding me? He was definitely overreacting about the entire 'seeing-naked' situation. I didn't bother calling Laura. She was probably in her dancing class. That thing could last for hours. Who else? I
                                            realized I didn't have many friends. It probably had to do with the fact that I was a shy person and I barely talked to anyone at school. But seriously, two friends? Well, at least, they were true friends. I
                                            stared at my phone watching how the mails from comments and messages from wattpad were being received. They reminded me of Evan. I felt really sad, I really needed a distraction. So, I found myself dialing Jerkpid's
                                            number. Even though, I was still mad at him for playing with me in the kitchen the other day. He was the only one who apparently could answer his phone after the first ring, "Hello there," his arrogant voice
                                            made me regret calling him. "Hey, Shane," "Oh Jones, I knew you couldn't survive without me," I swear I could see him smirking "You miss me, babe?" "Cut it out, Mr. Flirt," "Mr. Flirt?" he laughed for a moment.
                                            "Yeah, listen," I didn't know what to say or how to say it, "what are you doing?" "Men's stuff, why?" I narrowed my eyes and then felt stupid because he could not see me. "You're trying to get a girl for the
                                            night, aren't you?" I heard him gasp. "You read my mind! I knew you were a witch. Your bad choice of clothes gave it away," "That doesn't make any sense, you idiot," "It does to me," he chuckled "as much as
                                            your call pleases me, I cannot help but wonder the reason behind it," "Hum, I was wondering if you... we could... I..." I trailed off nervously. "If you want a date with me, just say it, babe," "Not a date and
                                            stop calling me babe," I paused as I knew he was waiting for me to speak "I just need someone to talk to," I blurted out and froze. Shane stayed in silence for a few seconds. "Well, we are talking, aren't we?"
                                            "I mean, I need to get out of my house, get some fresh air and since I live in the middle of nowhere. I'm stuck here unless someone picks me up," "And you thought that someone could be me," he finished for me.
                                            "Yeah," "Why would I get my precious car out of my garage and drive to the middle of nowhere to pick up a girl who has claimed to hate me passionately?" my brain took its time to understand the long question.
                                            "Is that a no?" I asked confused. "No, it means I need an incentive, a stimulus to do it. What do you have to offer, Jones?" "Hum, cookies?" "Not enough," "Chips?" "Try harder," "Ruffles?" I was sacrificing
                                            my little buddies for this. I couldn't believe it. "That may work but I need something else," "I don't have anything else to give you," "Yes, you do," "What do you want?" I placed my free hand on my hip impatiently.
                                            "I'll tell you when I get there but you have to promise you will do it," "I'm not going to have sex with you," I warned just in case. Shane laughed. "It's not sex, Jones. You couldn't get me hard even you try,"
                                            "What's that supposed to mean?" "Never mind, want me to pick you up or not?" "Yes," "then promise it," "Fine, I promise I will do what you want when you get here," "Alright, I'll be there on five," he hung up.
                                            Five minutes? What was he? A fast and furious' driver? I shook my head, I felt like I made a mistake but oh well, anything was better than staying alone in my house watching how Evan ignored me as he flirted
                                            with some stupid girl. Shane was a pain in the ass but he could at least entertain me for a while. I enjoyed getting under his skin. But I wasn't certainly not prepared for what was about to come. X M W L X
                                            Yes! That is the end of the chapter! It is not a cliffhanger so put away those potatoes, you mean people! he he, thank you so much for your awesome hilarious comments. You made me laugh out loud in public, at

                                            for your support &lt;3 Thanks t Misswatty for the banner Unedited story. Sorry for mistakes, read on your own risk :D My Wattpad Love Chapter 11 "This is a bad idea" I whispered to no one in particular whilst
                                            I was going downstairs. I could hear Shane's horn from the outside. It seemed like he was playing the drums on his horn. "I'm coming!" I shouted hoping he could hear me through the noise he was making. I opened
                                            the front door and closed it behind me. The fresh morning breeze hit my skin and I instantly felt better. It didn't surprise me to see a SUV parked in front of my house. It was a Honda CR V 2010. Shane's family
                                            had money; I knew this because of my mother. She usually told me things I wasn't interested in. Shane got off the SUV and walked around it to face me. He was wearing worn jeans and a loose black t-shirt. His
                                            pale skin stood out of it. His hair was purposely messy giving him his usual bad boy look. I couldn't help but notice the amusement plastered on his face. He walked towards me, smirking. "What?" I asked curious.
                                            He was up to something, I could tell. "Nothing, where are my chips?" he said frowning at my empty hands. "I thought you said chips were not enough motivation," "I said I wanted the chips, plus your promise of
                                            doing whatever I want," "Except sex," I felt the need to point that out. Shane chuckled. "You really think I would have sex with you?" he pointed me and gave me an are-you-out -of-your-mind look. Ok, I must
                                            admit that hurt my ego. I narrowed my eyes at him. "Whatever, I ran out of chips," I lied shamelessly "Besides, I think my promise is enough," I folded my arms across my chest and lifted my chin defiantly. Shane
                                            opened his mouth to protest but I raised my hand stopping him, "let's go," I ordered walking past him. He had no choice but to follow me. I got inside his SUV. Instantly, the smell of spices and a delicious
                                            man's perfume hit my nostrils. It was really warm and comfortable here. I could really get used to be in this car. Shane got in the driver's seat and started the engine. He drove off and I wondered where he
                                            was taking me. He hadn't said a word. "Where are we going?" I noticed we were heading to town. "McDonalds," "McDonalds? Why?" I scowled at him, "I'm not hungry," ok, that was a lie and my stomach fought for
                                            honesty by roaring like a caged lion. Shane laughed softly. "You sure about that?" I glared at him. "Listen," I ignored his question "I don't have any money on me," I admitted embarrassed. It was better to tell
                                            him now that when we were ordering or something. "Don't worry about that, today the food is on me," I narrowed my eyes at him. "Why are you being so nice to me? What are you up to?" Shane grinned like a cat
                                            getting in the line to the auto-mac. "I can be nice," "No, you can't," I was about to interrogate him further when it was our turn to order. I let him order whatever he wanted for me. It was embarrassing enough
                                            for me to let him pay. We were soon on road again, leaving the town behind us. Where were we going? I furrowed my eyebrows but didn't bother asking him. He pulled over in the middle of the lonely road. "Why
                                            are we stopping here?" I asked worried about my safety. Was he going to feed me, then kill me and throw my body in a river? I really needed to stop watching CSI episodes. They were making me paranoid. Shane,
                                            being the stupid jerk he was, ignored me and jumped out of the SUV. I got off as well. Food in hand, Shane started walking inside the woods "Shane? Where are you going?" "Just follow me," he shouted back. Groaning
                                            in frustration, I started to follow him. I hated walking in the forest. Don't get me wrong, I loved nature and all. The thing is that I had no skills whatsoever when it came to walk on a rocky bushy surface.
                                            "Shane!" I tried getting his attention but I was again simply ignored. Everyone seemed to ignore me today, first Evan and now Shane. What was I doing here anyway? It wasn't like Jerkpid was my friend. It was
                                            costing me all my strength and concentration to catch up with him. Starting with the fact that he was significantly taller than me which meant his steps were larger. "Shane! Where are w-ah!" I stepped on a rock
                                            and I swear I saw everything in slow motion. I tried not to fall, really tried, but of course I failed. I could see the ground getting closer and closer to me. I ended up falling on my hands and knees. Shane's
                                            laughter echoed through the silent woods. "You...face..." I could understand a word he was saying. Basically, because he wasn't uttering a coherent sentence. He was too busy laughing whilst clutching his stomach.
                                            I got on my feet and shook the dust of my pants and hands. "Hilarious," I said sarcastically. Shane stopped laughing and wiped his tears away. "You entertain me, Jones," "Why did you bring me here?" I folded
                                            my arms across my chest "if you're going to kill me, you could have done it in the house. We were alone," "You always think I want to kill you," he stated frowning "I'm not a killer, you know," he gave his back
                                            to me and got on his way. After going through 1352 trees, stepping on 123 rocks and almost falling 10 times, we finally reached our destination. Ok, maybe I exaggerated the numbers a little bit but I was exhausted.
                                            I was no longer walking, I was dragging myself through the trees. Shane looked perfect, he didn't even look tired. He was a football player, I bet this was nothing to him. I rested my back against a tree. I
                                            was out of breath, I would probably pass out if I continue walking. I was really out of shape. "We're here," Shane informed from some place ahead of me. "Yay!" I exclaimed sarcastically. It was then I looked
                                            forwards and my jaw dropped to the ground. We were in front of a mighty river, you could see the giant tress surrounding it. There was grass everywhere, lining the river bank "wow," I said breathless, literally
                                            "This is... wow," I swallowed feeling my dry throat. Shane sat down and proceed to open his bag of food. He glanced at me over his shoulder. "Are you going to stand there all day?" He said giving his hamburger
                                            a bite. My mouth watered, I was starving. Motivated by hunger, I approached to him and sat down next to him. He gave me my food and stared at the lake. To say I was confused was an understatement. Why did he
                                            bring me here? This looked like a... Jeez, I couldn't even think about that word. Date... Yeah, this looked like a date. But it was not a date, right? We ate our food silently. I gazed at the river in silence.
                                            It was refreshing to hear the noises of the water running through the rocks. I glanced at Shane, he seemed to be enjoying the sight. His hazel eyes had a glint I'd never seen before. His full lips were forming
                                            a genuine smile. He looked at me and we locked gazes. I swallowed. "Why are we here?" I had to ask. Shane's smile turned into a smirk. "Well, I couldn't risk my reputation by taking you to a public place, so"
                                            he shrugged his shoulders. I got on my feet feeling insulted, Shane imitated my movements. "You are a jerk," I said frankly. "So what? You still owe me," "What do you want?" I folded my arms across my chest
                                            for the second time this day. "What do I want?" He held his chin as if he was deep in thought. "Just say it," I pushed even when I was kind of scared of what he could possibly want me to do. I mean, he was a
                                            jerk. Who knows what kind of twisted thoughts went through his head? "Do you really want to know?" he cocked an eyebrow teasingly. "Yes," "I want a kiss," my eyes widened in shock and my lips parted. I couldn't
                                            help blushing fiercely. Shane was looking right into my eyes, hovering me. My heart started hammering inside my chest. "No," "Why not?" he titled his head to the side and took a step closer to me. "I-I don't...
                                            no," "You're going to break your promise?" he asked approaching to me. I was about to take a step back when he grabbed my arm "If you break your promise, I may just steal the kiss then," "No, let me go!" I fought
                                            to release myself. Shane let me go and burst out laughing. I frowned at him. "You really entertain me," he said among laughter and gave his back to me. He sat on a rock. "You were joking?" I asked in disbelief.
                                            "Of course I was joking," he stated as it was the most obvious thing in the world "I would never kiss you," his words stung. He really enjoyed hurting my ego. I swallowed my hurt pride and put on a careless
                                            facade. "Then what do you want?" "I need your help," "If you tell me to help you with Math, I swear to God I'll-" "No," he cut me off "I won't make the same mistake twice," "Good," "I want you to help me with
                                            Melissa," "Melissa?" I asked confused "Who is Melissa?" "The hot chick in my math class," "Are you serious?" I moved my hands exasperated. "Yeah," he nodded, "she seems immune to my charms, besides, she's not
                                            only hot but really smart," "She sure is smart for not falling for your looks," "Yeah, she's a genius," Shane looked up at the sky and sighed. "You're in love with her?" "No, I just want to screw her but damn,
                                            she's playing hard to get and I've been hard for a while now so," "Oh my God! Shane! You are such a pervert!" "What? I've being honest here," "Save your honesty for yourself," I scrunched my nose "and how on
                                            Earth am I going t help you? I don't even know her," "Talk to her or something. Tell her I'm great in the sac or something like that," "Wow, you suck at making plans. I can't just go and talk her all of the
                                            sudden," "Yes, you can and you will. You owe me," I groaned in frustration. I knew this was a bad idea, why didn't I listen to my smart inner voice? Suddenly, an idea came t me. "Fine, fine but I have one condition."
                                            "I reject it," "Then there's no deal," I shot back. Shane gave me a suspicious look. "What do you want?" "A kiss," I teased grinning. Shane chuckled. "Very funny," "No, actually, I want you to help Laura with
                                            Jordan," "Who the hell is Laura?" "My best friend, she's been your neighbor for years," "I don't know her," "Whatever, help her out and we have a deal," "Jordan is kind of picky when it comes to girls," Shane
                                            added. "I don't care, that's the deal. Take it or leave it," "Fine fine," Shane agreed and we shook hands. After our little pact, Shane decided to climb some rocky waterfall. I sat on a rock and watched him,
                                            hoping he could fall in the water or something like that but damn he was skilled. He knew exactly how to climb. I got my phone out of my pocket, feeling bored. My heart started beating fast whilst I was scrolling
                                            down the mails from wattpad. I stopped breathing when I read one specific mail: "DarkPoet001 sent you a message" I clicked the message opened and proceeded to read it: "I don't need your help :) The girl already
                                            fell for me," My chest tightened painfully. I knew he was talking about the girl he was flirting with. He was replying to my earlier message when I offered him to help him with the girl. I would not show him
                                            how much this was getting to me. It was a good thing, he couldn't see me because my face was a mirror of my emotions right in this moment. I started typing a message for him, Me: I'm happy for you then. I was
                                            surprised by the quickness of his reply, Him: thank you ;) Me: No problem. Him: She's really hot. God, he was killing me. Couldn't he see it? Me: Good for you. Him: She's realistic and has dark vision of the
                                            world like me. We have so much in common. Me: Good. Him: Her voice is really sexy. That was it. I couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't talk to him any longer. Me: Hum, I gotta go. Him: Why? Me: I'm on a date.
                                            I really don't know why I said that. I was just so hurt that I wanted him to feel the same. I wanted to hurt him. Him: Really? With who? Me: You don't know him. Him: You're lying. Me: I'm not lying. Why would
                                            I lie? Him: I don't know. Me: I'm not lying, alright? Him: Sure. Me: Evan... Him: You can date whoever you want. I don't really care. Me: Why are you being such a jerk? Him: I'm being honest. Me: You're being
                                            rude and mean. Him: I'm being frank. Me: You really don't care about me, do you? Him: Why would I? You're just some girl I met on the internet. Ok, that was harsh. Tears sprung to my eyes. I bit my lower lip
                                            trying to hold them back. I shoved my phone inside my pocket and took a deep breath in. Don't cry, Jules, don't cry. I chanted inside my head with my eyes closed. What was wrong with him? I knew I was not just
                                            some girl he met on the internet. We were friends, we had talked so much. He knew everything about me, I knew almost everything about him. Why would he say that? I opened my eyes to meet... a shirtless Shane?
                                            "Jones!" he screamed loudly. He was standing precariously on a rock at the top of the waterfall. His six pack was on sight, he was grinning like a maniac. "What the hell are you doing?!" I shouted scared. I
                                            was not a fan of Shane but he could seriously kill himself if he jumped off that rock. "I'm having fun," he said before jumping off the rock. "No!" he dived in the water majestically, splashing water to me.
                                            I shrieked backing away but my t-shirt was damp in a matter of seconds Shane emerged from the water and laughed. His brownish blond hair looked dark and wet "You stupid egocentric jerk!" I screamed angry. Quickly,
                                            I took my phone and put it far away from the water. The last thing I needed was my phone to get wet and damaged. I really couldn't afford another one. My eyes landed on the screen and my heart came to a halt.
                                            Evan had replied. His reply fastened my breathing and increased my heart beats. His words were melting me. I couldn't help reading them over and over again: "I like you, Jules," x M W L X Aww sweet ending, huh?
                                            I'm a sucker for sweet endings. Anyway, I've received many messages asking about the cast for this story and I have no idea about who could play who so help me out, you lazy potatoes launchers! Hehe! of course,
                                            first tell me your thoughts about the chapter and then your suggestions for the cast! Love and orange broccolis (Yes, they exist. I have colorful fruits and vegetables, be jealous) Arix *******************************************
                                            [12] Chapter 12 ******************************************* You guys rock! You all have a piece of my black heart! My Wattpad Love Chapter 12 I was going to die. Period. I was breathless, literally, there was
                                            no air entering my lungs. I had stopped breathing in the exact moment I read Evan's message. My heart was beating so fast inside my chest that I could feel the beats in my throat and ears. What was wrong with
                                            me? It was only a message. I needed to breathe. There was no way I was dying now, at least not without replying his message. But what was I supposed to say? He said he liked me. God, Evan admitted he liked me.
                                            A giggle escaped my lips ending my self-inflicted respiratory arrest. I no longer felt butterflies in my stomach, they were more like eagles now. Unicorns and flowers were going to erupt from my pores anytime
                                            soon. wow, that was too much, wasn't it? Act cool and natural... I started typing a message but erased it over and over again. Should I tell him I liked him, too? I really sucked at these types of things. There
                                            should be books about what to do in this situation. You know tips to date. There are books about it, you idiot. My inner voice snapped at me. Yeah yeah, I guess I should really read one of those. Focusing on
                                            my phone, I typed a reply. Me: I like you, too. I swallowed a lump in my throat and sent it. My hands were sweaty. He didn't reply for a few minutes, those were the longest minutes of my life by the way. Him:
                                            I know ;) I narrowed my eyes at his chesty reply. Me: Arrogant much? Him: It's the truth. I knew you like me. Me: How? Him: You're too obvious. Me: No, I'm not. Wait... you like me...as a friend or...? Him:
                                            You know the answer to that question. Me: I do? Him: Yes ;) Me: I don't think so. Him: ;) Me: Evan... Him: Yeah? Me: never mind. Him: what is it? Me: I want to know... Him: what? Me: You can't expect me to be
                                            all cool after we admitted to like each other. Him: why are you making a big deal of this? Me: It is a big deal to me. Him: Why? You haven't even seen me. I typed a reply and clicked 'send' then, I heard the
                                            most terrifying sound I'd heard in my life: My phone's low battery signal. "No,no,no,no" I exclaimed terrified "you can't do this to me," I begged to the device in my hands. I was literally on my hands and knees
                                            waiting for the message to be sent. Sending... Sending... "Come on!" I was starting to panic. and then it happened. My stupid selfish idiotic phone went off. "No! Damn it! Arg!" I groaned and let out a sigh
                                            of frustration. Did Evan get my message? Did I send it? What was he thinking now? "Jones!" Shane's voice got my attention. "What?" I asked annoyed glancing at him over my shoulder. He was floating around the
                                            water with a huge grin plastered on his face. I got up and turned to him. "What?" I repeated. "Get in the water," "Ehh... let me think about it," I held my chin pretending to be deep in thought, "No, never,
                                            nah, nei, not gonna happen," I gave him a closed mouth smile. Shane narrowed his eyes at me. "come on, it's really warm," "I said no," "It's better if you get here willingly," "What's that supposed to mean?"
                                            Shane gave me a devilish smile. "You wouldn't want me to drag you here, would you?" "Oh, you wouldn't," "Yes, I would," "You wouldn't," I shook my head taking a step backwards. Shane started swimming to the
                                            river bank. I took three more steps backwards. Run! "I know what you're thinking," Shane said getting out of the water. He was shirtless. His abdomen was on sight and I really needed self-control not to stare.
                                            His pants were damped sticking to his muscular legs, "I would catch you in a heartbeat if you try to run," he whispered darkly. Being the half-witted person I was, I turned on my feet and ran for my life. Remember
                                            the fact that I was not good at walking through the forest? Well, imagine how much I sucked at running through it. I grimaced in pain as the rocks hit my feet. It was a good thing I had my converse. I felt stupid.
                                            What was I thinking? It was useless to run. Shane was a football player; he was taller and faster than me so what was the point of running? To save your dignity. I kept my futile attempt of escape ignoring the
                                            pain in my toes each time I stepped on a rock. I really needed to learn how to walk on this type of surface. If I ever got to a survival situation, you know like when people get lost in the woods or the plane
                                            crashed in an isolated island; I was sure I was going to be dead before I could even realized I was in a life and death situation. My survival instincts sucked big day. "Jones!" Shane wrapped his arm around
                                            my waist from behind. I shrieked and felt a dÃ©jÃ  vu sensation. This was exactly how it happened that day I tried to run from him. "Let go of me!" I was not going to give up without putting up a fight. I struggled,
                                            kicked, screamed and even tried to bite his arm. Shane didn't even flinch or made no attempt to let me go. "Stop struggling!" He exclaimed steadying me. I growled like a savage animal. It was then he pressed
                                            me against his body and I could feel his wet naked torso on my back. I could feel the heat coming from his skin. Shivers went through my spine as his hot breath began brushing the back of my neck. "Shane, let
                                            me go," I said each word slowly but couldn't help feeling nervous. We were too close for my like. Too closed. "Nope," Shane stated and bended over to lift me and carry me bridal style. "No! No!" I screamed hitting
                                            his hard chest as he walked back to the river. He was carrying effortlessly as if I weighed nothing "Shane! Stop! Don't do it! I will kill you!" Shane grinned down at me as he reached the river bank "Shane!
                                            Don't do it! Please! I..." Think of something, Jules! "I can't swim!" Wow, it was the first time I was actually telling a good reasonable lie. "It's not a deep river," was Shane's reply before throwing me to
                                            the water. I screamed so loud, I swear I saw birds and owls running away from these woods. I landed on a big amount of cold water. I was swallowed by the river for a few seconds, my entire body shook by the
                                            unexpected change of temperature. I felt like small needles were piercing my bones softly. I emerged to the surface taking a puff of air, Shane was standing on a rock laughing. "You stupid prick! You Idiotic
                                            self-centered bastard! You... You..." I was really angry but I was also running out insults. It wasn't like I had a big variety anyway, I was not a violent person but Shane definitely knew how to make me one
                                            "I'm going to kill you!" I promised him and I was really thinking about hitting him with a rock and throw him his body to the river. Jeez, I really needed to stop watching thrillers "You are so dead!" I yelled
                                            at him swimming to the rock where he was. I was pissed off. I was not a fan of water besides this was freaking cold. I was going to die of hypothermia. "How is the water?" He asked smirking at me. "I hope you
                                            choke with your own saliva!" I aimed my finger at him "what's wrong with you?!" "Oh, nothing, just thought you may need a bath. You stung," I glared at him. "I hate you," I said passionately. "No, you don't.
                                            I'm too hot to be hated," "You have a big ego, don't you?" I stared up at him. "Yes," he replied arrogantly. "I bet that's the only big thing you have," It was my time to smirk up at him. Shane narrowed his
                                            eyes at me. "Nice one, Jones, but I suggest you don't start something you can't finish," he folded his arms across his chest. "What do you mean?" I frowned confused. He squatted to be at my level. "You're too
                                            innocent for your own good," he patted my head. I gave him a killer look, I got my hands on the rock to push myself up but slipped back down. "Jesus, this is slippery and wet," I complained. "That's what she
                                            said," Shane chuckled. I made a gag gesture. "You are disgusting," I said finally getting out of the water. My clothes were sticking to my body. Shane's hazel eyes dropped from my face to chest and went down
                                            to my legs. I swallowed "Hey!" I snapped my fingers in front of his face, "were you checking me out?" "I just realized you have an okay body. I mean, you're too skinny but I could still fu-" "Shane!" I punched
                                            his chest "You are such a pervert!" my lower lip quivered from the cold. I was sure I was turning purple. "Let's go back before you pass out from the cold," he said starting to walk to the woods. I glared at
                                            his back whilst following him. ** "Mom! I'm home!" I shouted getting inside my house but of course I got no reply. My mother was probably still at the hospital. Shane had brought me home and then drove off saying
                                            he had something to do, well, he actually said he was going to 'bang' someone or something like that. I couldn't remember his words but I knew they were nasty. I let myself fall on my couch and closed my eyes.
                                            Evan... He hadn't left my mind in the entire day. How was it possible to like someone you haven't even seen? My phone was off so I plugged it to the nearest electric outlet and took a shower. After putting some
                                            warm clothes on, I went downstairs. I picked up my laptop and turned it on. Checking wattpad, I noticed my last message hadn't been sent just I expected. I sent a message saying hi to Evan but he didn't reply.
                                            That was how my boring Saturday started. I had nothing to do, well, I actually needed to do my homework but I didn't feel like doing it right now. The night arrived and I was lying on my couch, checking wattpad
                                            each five minutes. Where was he? Most of the time he was online, it was weird not to get an instant reply from him. My face brightened up when I saw him online. Him: Hi back. Me: Finally, you're here. Him: you
                                            were waiting for me? ;) Me: Hum, kind of. Him: haha I know you can't live without me, peachy girl. me: I thought we have gotten over the nicknames stage. Him: Never. Me: I should make up a pet name for you then.
                                            Him: Nah, you're not creative enough, Mrs. Strawberry. Me: Right. Him: Do you have Skype? My heart stopped, ok, not literally because if my heart stopped I would be dead in a matter of seconds but you get my
                                            meaning. The eagles inside my stomach started fluttering making me feel nervous. Of course, I had Skype. It was program design to video chat. I usually used it with Laura or even Jason. Me: Yes, why? I squeezed
                                            my sweaty hands waiting for his reply. Him: Add me. He gave me his Skype account and I was too socked to do something. Me: You want to video chat... right now? Him: Yes ;) I clicked the Skype program opened
                                            in my laptop and logged in my account. I proceed to add him and he accepted me very quickly. My God, i wasn't ready to see him. My heart was hammering inside my chest, my throat was dry. My stomach kept fluttering,
                                            I felt like I was going to be sick anytime soon. I was going to see him... I was going to see Evan for the first time... I needed to breathe, I couldn't pass out. His chat window on Skype popped up and it started
                                            loading the images from both cameras, his and mine. I combed my hair with my fingers desperately. Jeez, I was not prepared for this. What if he sees me and thinks I'm ugly? What does he look like? Many questions
                                            were prowling around my collapsed mind. The loading process ended and the little boxes were our images displayed turned black before showing both of us. My heart skipped a beat as I looked at the face of the
                                            boy I liked for the first time. "Hi," he whispered with that sexy voice of his. X M W L x A/N: Muahahaaa this is the most evil cliffhanger I've ever written :P Sorry but I just couldn't help it! It's like a
                                            drug to me. For your information, guys, I upload each four of five days. I may even upload weekly. It depends on my work. I work from 6 am to 6 pm so be considerate with me. I had a busy life. Love and strawberries

                                            Calm down, people! :D Here's the new chapter! Dedicated to Ellengreenxo for making the awesome trailer to the right &gt;&gt;&gt; and xHearMeRawrX for the fantastic banner! Chapter 13 Three words. Evan Was Extremely
                                            Hot. Ok, those were actually four words but you can't blame me for not thinking straight right now. My eyes were glued to the square on my laptop's screen. I was staring at the most sexy hot guy I'd ever seen
                                            in my life. He was not the muscled hot type; he was more like the sexy mysterious hot type of guy. His hair was midnight black; it was all shaggy partly covering his ears and forehead. His pale skin was flawless.
                                            His dark eyes seemed to go on forever. His thick eyebrows leaded the way down to straight-edged shape nose and finally, his full lips. He was wearing a black t-shirt that matched his eyes and hair. I was speechless.
                                            I had never felt so self-conscious. He was probably thinking I was ugly. My brown hair was falling messily down my shoulders and I had no make-up on whatsoever. I wasn't hot or anything like that. I was average.
                                            I had a pair of big blue eyes that was all I'd got. "Hey," I finally greeted him back nervously. My pounding heart was going to jump out of my chest. The eagles inside my stomach turned into dragons and fluttered
                                            around making feel sick. I was seeing him.... He was seeing me... Oh God, what was he thinking of me? "So you're Jules?" he asked smiling at me through the camera. his voice sent a shiver through my spine. "So
                                            you're Evan," I tried to say casually and swallowed feeling my dry throat. Where the hell did all my saliva go? "Are you alone?" his black eyes seemed to be swallowing in a slow but steady process. I nodded
                                            at his question, "so, tell me, how is it that a girl like you ended up being my friend?" it hurt to hear him say 'friend' it made me wonder if when he'd said he liked me, did he mean it as a friend? But I pushed
                                            the thought away. "What do you mean 'a girl like me'?" I furrowed my eyebrows. "Well, you are all happiness and love while I'm a negative realistic jerk," "You're admitting you're a jerk?" I cocked an eyebrow.
                                            "I never said I wasn't," he smirked at me and my heart skipped a beat. Cute dimples appeared on his cheeks making him look devilish adorable. Breathe, Jules, Breathe "I could ask you the same thing. I thought
                                            you hated me," I was trying to act casual but I was failing miserably. "Why are you so nervous?" he tilted his head to the side. Amusement plastered on his face. "I'm not nervous," I said in a puff. "Yes, you
                                            are," he teased and I looked away. "So, what's up?" I looked at his image on the screen again and he still had that arrogant smirk on his face. "I wanna try something," he whispered. "What?" "What color is your
                                            underwear?" my eyes widened and I couldn't help blushing fiercily. My face was as red as a tomato. "You..." An insult didn't come to my mind. Evan laughed loudly. God, even his laughter was sexy. I glared at
                                            him until he was done laughing. "I knew you would do that," "What?'" "Blush like that, you're so innocent, Jules," his eyes held a glint of something I couldn't decipher. "You are a pervert," I accused him.
                                            "No, I am not," he ran his fingers through his hair messing it a little. I gawked at him like a stupid person. Anytime soon I was going to start drooling all over my laptop "I just enjoying teasing you, Mrs.
                                            Strawberry," my breathe was caught inside my lungs. Those nicknames sounded so good coming from him. Evan cleared his throat. I realized my mouth was hanging partly opened so I regained my composure and gave
                                            him a closed mouth smile. "You should stop it with the pet names," "Why?" "Because we're friends," I slurred the last word. Why was it that I couldn't deal with the fact that he thought of me as a friend? I
                                            mean, I understand him. We met on the internet. It was not like he was going to like more than a friend, right? Those stuff didn't happen. We hadn't even faced each other personally. It was then I realized how
                                            bad I wanted to meet him in the real world, which brought me to the next question I made "Where do you live?" Evan's smile vanished and he looked deadly serious for a moment. "Are you stalking me again, Jules?"
                                            he pretended to be scared. "No, I just want to know," "Why?" "I'm curious besides, you're my friend," "Does it matter?" "Yes," I stated frankly. I watched him hesitate. "I should go now," he said scratching
                                            the back of his head. "No, don't leave," "I have things to do," he stated coldly. "Why can't you just tell me? Do you seriously think I'm going to stalk you?" I was confused. Evan let out a long sigh. "We are
                                            miles away, Jules. That is all you need to know," "It's not enough," I needed to know. "Yes, it is," "Jules," his dark eyes looked at me seriously. I felt like he was seeing right through me even when we were
                                            seeing each other over a web camera "Drop it," he whispered and then logged off. I stared at the black screen where his sexy face had been a few seconds ago. Why couldn't he tell me? I shut my laptop and rubbed
                                            my face. What was I doing? "We are miles away, Jules. That is all you need to know," Those words kept spinning around my head. My heart was sinking in my chest. Was he telling the truth? What was I going to
                                            do if he was miles away from me? I raked my fingers through my hair. "What are you doing, Jules?" I wondered aloud. Evan was getting to me in a way I'd ever expected him to. I liked him, I really really liked
                                            him. In fact, he was the first guy to make me feel so many things. All these sensations were new for me but how was it possible? Was it possible to like someone that much without personally knowing him? I closed
                                            my eyes and let out of a long sigh. His face came to mind. He was so sexy, I smiled like a fool remembering the cute dimples that formed on his cheeks when he smirked. I checked my phone, there were no new mails
                                            so Evan hadn't messaged me. I looked down sadly and went upstairs. It was almost midnight already. I threw myself on my bed landing on my back. My eyes met the wooden ceiling, I stared at it in silence. I knew
                                            I was going to have a hard time falling sleep due to my unhealthy sleeping routine. I tossed around my bed desperately. I wanted to sleep so I didn't have to think. I was almost succeeding when my phone rang.
                                            I checked the screen narrowing my eyes at the sudden amount of light. ID Jason Rocks :D Yeah, he registered his number like that in my phone. I frowned. Did he finally get over the me-seeing-him-naked incident?
                                            "Hello?" I answered. There were noises and loud background music. "Juuleeess!" A girl shouted sounding excited "Julieee!" it was then I recognized the voice. "Laura?" I sat up totally surprised. "I lovee youu,
                                            Juleees! You know that, don't you?" she slurred excitedly. Wait... "Are you drunk?" Lau was not the type of girl to drink. In fact, I'd never seen her drunk in my life. "No, yes, no, I mean, yeah," she hiccupped
                                            "maybe," "What the hell... Where are you?" I demanded worried. "This party is amazing! I... Jordan... he's so hot..." "Lau, where are you?" I repeated my question swinging my feet out of bed. "Amanda's party!
                                            Yeah!" she shouted and the people in the background followed her. "Who the hell is Amanda? What are you doing there? Where's Jason?" "Who's Jason?" Laura inquired laughing. "Our friend, the owner of the phone
                                            you're using," I reminded her exasperated. "Oh, Jay, jay!" "Jay Jay?" "That's his name," Lau giggled. "Lau, I need to talk to Jason," I stated. It was obvious she was a lost cause. "Oh wait... he's.... Jay Jay!"
                                            she called him out and I moved the phone away from my ear. Jesus, she practically screamed in my eardrum "He's coming," there were a lot of noises, voices, screams before I heard Jason's voice. "Hello," his
                                            voice sounded neutral for a moment. "Jason, where the he-" "JUlie! I've missed you sooooo much!" he shouted over the phone. "Oh God," I said face palming myself "Of course, you're drunk, too," I mumbled. "I'm
                                            so sorry for what happened! You are my best friend in the world, Jules!" "Shut up! Where are you?" "We are... hum... we are at..." he hesitated, "Banana's party," "Banana? You mean, Amanda?" "Yeah, her, she's
                                            so cool," "How-Ah, never mind, is there a sober person there?" "What?" "Is there a sober per-" the line went dead. Groaning in frustration, I dialed his number again but only to hear his voicemail. I called
                                            Laura but she didn't pick up her phone. "Arg!" What the hell were they thinking? They were never the party-like type of people. Why were they drunk and who were on Earth was Amanda? Why didn't Laura tell me
                                            anything about a party? I could understand why Jason didn't, I mean, he didn't even speak to me. But Laura? That girl told me everything she did. They were my best friends. They were drunk somewhere out there.
                                            I needed to do something. What could I do? Shane... Yeah, if there was a party somewhere he was obviously there. He wasn't the school's golden boy for nothing. Reluctantly, I dialed his number. It rang a few
                                            times before he answered. "Wow, two calls in a day," his smug voice made me roll my eyes "You really want me, Jones," "Get over yourself, where are you?" "Why should I answer your question at..." he seemed to
                                            be looking at his watch "1:30 am," "Are you at Amanda's party?" "How do you know?" See? I was really smart. "I need you to do something for me," "Whoa, whoa, slow down, we're not friends," "Shane, this is a
                                            life and death situation," "I don't believe you," "Fine, it's not but please-" "I need a motivation," I sighed in frustration. "I will speak to Merissa or whatever her name is," I offered. That was the hot girl
                                            he liked in his math's class. "You already promised that, and her name is Melissa," "Fine, I will make her fall for you in a week," "You give me your word?" "Yeah," "Alright, what do you want this time?" "I
                                            need you to look for Jason and Laura and bring them here," "Why?" "Just do it," "Fine but I don't know who's Laura," "Jesus, Shane she's been your neighbor your entire life," "Really?" "Yes, now go and find
                                            them. Do not take them to their houses. Bring them here. Their mothers will snap if they see them drunk," "Wait, they're drunk?" "Move!" "Fine!" he hung up rudely. ** I was pacing around my living room like
                                            a caged lion. It'd been forty five minutes since I spoke to Shane. What was taking him so long? I heard an engine and I ran out of the house. The cold night air hit my bare skin. I was wearing a night gown,
                                            before you think I looked sexy, believe me I didn't. Shane parked and jumped out of the car. He was wearing dark jeans, a loose t-shirt and a black jacket. I could see the annoyance plastered on his face. "Julie!"
                                            Jason shouted getting off the back seat. He stumbled towards me. He was a mess "Julie!" he pulled me into a tight hug. The smell of liquor enveloped me. "Where is Laura?" I mouthed to Shane over Jason's shoulder.
                                            Shane shrugged. I frowned and took Jason inside the house. I threw him on the couch and it surprised me how quickly he fell asleep. I turned to Shane angrily. "Where is she?" I folded my arms across my chest.
                                            "She's with Jordan," Shane said shrugging. "What?!" "Yeah, he offered her a ride home," "Are you out of your mind? She was drunk!" "Hey, Jordan is not a bad guy. He is going to take care of her," "That's bullsh*t!
                                            Oh God," I held my forehead dramatically. "She's going to be alright, stop the drama," "Drama?" I asked moving my hands exasperated "She's in danger," "Jordan will take care of her, I promise," Shane said seriously.
                                            I sighed in defeat. Shane approached to me slowly. I had to tilt my head back to look at his face. "What?" he smiled down at me and cupped my cheek. I shivered at the contact. His hazel eyes were looking right
                                            into my blue ones. "You look like an angry kitten," he twisted a smile amused. I narrowed my eyes at him. "What's that supposed to mean?" his thumb caressed my cheek softly. What was he doing? "Nothing," he
                                            retreated his hand back and scratched the back of his head "I gotta go," "Shane..." he gave his back to me and left slamming the front door closed behind him. What was all that about? I went upstairs, leaving
                                            a snoring Jason on my couch. I landed on my bed for the second time that night. I checked my phone and smiled like a fool when I saw a message from Evan. He was already logged off but his goodnight message still
                                            brought a smile to my lips. "Goodnight, sweet Jules. You are too cute for your own good ;)" With those sweet words prowling inside my head, I fell asleep. X M W L X A/N: Hello there! See? No cliffhanger! I am
                                            a GOOD person : D Seriously, guys, I have a busy job so be patient with me :) Check out the awesome trailer to the right! Peace and Fried potatoes (Yeah, I found an use for all those potatoes you threw at me
                                            *winks*) Arix :P ******************************************* [14] Chapter 14 ******************************************* Awesome people reading this story in 5...4...3...2....1 Now! My Wattpad Love Chapter 14
                                            My bed had to be the most comfortable thing on Earth. It was soft like a cloud. I was waking up slowly feeling extremely rested. I was lying on my side when I felt something warm on my back. There was also something
                                            hard poking my ass. The warm thing moved and there was suddenly something heavy on my waist. Opening my eyes, I looked down at my waist and gasped. There was an arm wrapped there. "What the..." I mumbled with
                                            a sleepy voice. I rolled over to look behind me. My eyes met the peaceful sleeping face of Jason. I frowned in confusion. What the hell was he doing here? His chest was naked. My frown grew bigger and I looked
                                            down past his abdomen. I screamed loudly backing away from him. Jason's eyes snapped opened, before he could say anything I fell off the bed with a thud. It was a good thing the house had a carpeted floor otherwise
                                            that could have been really painful. "Jules?" Jason seemed to be searching for me. I jumped on my feet, my face was as red as it could get. Jason was sitting on the bed now, my sheets covering down his waist.
                                            "You! You... You're naked!" I shouted shocked. "Stop screaming!" he grimaced in pain, "my head is going to explode," "You're naked!" I repeated aiming my finger at him. "I'm not naked, I'm..." Jason looked under
                                            the sheets and his eyes widened "Ok, I'm naked," he acknowledged and looked up at me. "What the hell, Jason! Why are you naked?" "I don't know," he rubbed his temples, "it's hard to think when my head is throbbing
                                            like this," "And you were lying next to me... and that thing poked me! Oh my God! It poked me!" I scrunched my nose in disgust "I feel so violated," "Jules, you're overreacting," "Am I? I woke up to find my
                                            very excited best friend laying naked next to me. Excuse me, if I'm a little freak out here," "I'm sorry, I guess, I was cold last night and decided to come up and sleep with you," I held my forehead pacing
                                            around my room. Jason and I had slept together before. But really slept, we didn't have sex or anything like that. He was like my brother. Sometimes when Mom was on duty and he came over, he stayed all night
                                            long. But of course, nothing weird like this had ever happened to us. Jason got out of my bed covering his thing with my pillow. Oh my poor pillow! "I get that you were cold last night whilst sleeping on the
                                            couch," I paused and glanced at him. Jason was smiling apologetically "but I don't get why you're naked," "Well, apparently, I enjoy stripping when I'm drunk," he scratched the back of his head with his free
                                            hand. "Really, Jason? Really?" "Jules..." "That thing poked me! Why was it even...up?" I asked awkwardly, "It's the morning cramp; it has nothing to do with you," "You promise?" "Yeah," "I can't believe this,"
                                            I shook my head. "Oh come on, it wasn't like I did this on purpose," he explained seriously. I let out a sight of frustration "besides, it's not like you haven't seen me naked before," he tried to make a joke...
                                            I glared at him feeling my heated cheeks. Jason's smile vanished "too soon?" I nodded. "Just put some clothes on," I waved him off. Jason walked out of the room. I guess, his clothes were all over the couch.
                                            Wow, that was awkward. My life was getting a little bit crazy. Not to mention, now I had my best friend's little buddy portrayed inside my head. The image was so clear in my mind; I swear I could draw the damn
                                            thing if I wanted to. Even though, this was not the first time I'd seen naked, it was the first time I'd seen him....well... aroused. Let me tell you, that thing is huge. It kind of freaked me out a little bit
                                            back there. It poked me! I shuddered remembering that. I went to my bathroom and did my morning routine. I came back to my room to look for my sandals. "Take me by the tongue and I'll know you. Kiss me till
                                            you're drunk and I'll show you," my phone started singing loudly. That was Laura's ringtone. Yeah, she liked Maroon 5. I wasn't a big fan but hey that song was catchy "You want the moves like jagger, I've got
                                            the moves like jagger,I've got the mooooooves... like jagger" Laura... Instantly, I remembered she was drunk last night and Shane didn't bring her over. She was with Jordan. I run-and-jump ninja style to my
                                            bed and pressed the green button. "Hello?" I was out of breath. "Jules?! Thanks God! Jules, I'm in trouble," she spoke fast. She usually did that when she was freaking out. "Lau, what-" "I woke up in Jordan's
                                            bed... I'm..." she trailed off, I could tell she was biting her nails "I can't remember a thing about last night. But I'm only wearing his shirt," "Oh no," "I'm freaking out. I may not be a virgin anymore,"
                                            "Calm down, Lau, where is he?" "He's in the shower, I need to get out of here before he comes out but how am I supposed to leave wearing his shirt?" "Well, your house isn't that far from his house, is it?" I
                                            asked remembered they all actually lived in the same street: Shane, Jordan, Jason and Laura. I was the only one who lived in the isolated part of the town. Yay, lucky me. Oh sarcasm! "No, Jules but it's not
                                            like I can go home walking half-dressed like this. Oh God, Mom will kill me," "Go to Shane's house," I said surprising us both. "What? No, I don't even know him that much," "But I kind of do. Just go there,
                                            I'll call him," "I can't, I'd die of embarrassment," "Oh well, then stay there and face Jordan. I hope you're ready when he starts making comments about last night from which you can't remember a thing by the
                                            way," "Call him, I'm running there," "Ok," I hung up and dialed Shane's number. It rang a few times before I finally hear someone at the other side of the line. "Hello," a female sleepy voice greeted me. I frowned
                                            and looked at my Iphone's screen. Yeah, I definitely dialed the right number. "Hi, is Shane there?" "Yes, he's sleeping," she said softly "who is this?" "I really need to talk to him," "Who are you?" Her voice
                                            became cold. She was probably one of his night stands. "I'm his friend," I lied. Shane and I weren't exactly friends. "What friend?" "Listen, just put him on the phone. It's urgent," she hesitated but then I
                                            heard noises and a masculine grunt. "What?" Shane's asked annoyed. "I need another favor," "You seriously think we're friends," "Laura is coming over your house, help her out," "Why would I-who the hell is Laura?"
                                            "Oh God," I felt like slapping him right now "you have the memory of a dead fish," "I only remember important things," he retorted rudely. "Whatever, just open the door for her and help her out," "Why would
                                            I do that? I'm sleeping," "Please," I put my pride aside and begged "please," I heard him growl in frustration. "I cursed the day you got my phone number. Fine," he hung up. I smiled in relief but instantly
                                            grew worried. What if Laura lost her virginity last night? i knew it would devastate her if it did happened. She always dreamt about her first time being special with someone she loved. We were very alike in
                                            the sex terms. We both were waiting for our charming princes to arrive and all that stuff. She would be so depressed if Jordan and her had sex last night. She didn't even remember a thing for God sakes. I bet
                                            no one wants to be drunk on their first time. I looked down at my phone and smiled again when I noticed I had a message from Evan. Evan: Good morning, sunshine ;) The dragons in my stomach fluttered around and
                                            I couldn't help blushing a little. Me: Hey, you seem to be a in good mood today. Him: Yes, I had a great dream last night. Me: Really? What was it about? Him: I'll tell you later. I bit my lower lip in curiosity.
                                            Me: Why not now? Him: I have something to do, talk to you later, Mrs. Strawberry. I rolled my eyes and typed 'Ok' "Jules!" Jason shouted my name from downstairs. "What?" I shouted back. "Breakfast is ready!"
                                            he informed. "Oh no," I ran out of the room and then downstairs. Jason sucked at cooking so I was scared as hell of what he may have tried to prepared. I entered the kitchen. Jason was sitting on the counter;
                                            his mouth full of... pancakes? I grimaced in disgust at his full opened mouth. "You made pancakes?" he nodded as he swallowed what he was chewing. "They're pretty good," I looked at the plate in front of me.
                                            Pancakes are supposed to rounded, right? Well, Jason absolutely forgot about that detail. Their form was inexplicable "Just try it, they're good. I promise," he encouraged me to taste it. I shook my head, "come
                                            on, Jules," "Just a bite," I was about to take a bite when... "Sweetie, I'm home," my mother's voice echoed through the living room. "I'm in the kitchen!" I shouted whilst Jason got off the counter. "Hey," Mom
                                            greeted us stepping inside the kitchen. She looked tired, there were bags her blue eyes. Her reddish hair was in a messy bun. She smiled when she saw me and kissed my forehead "How are you?" she caressed my
                                            face gently. "I'm good, how was your night?" I asked watching her put some bags on the counter. She gave Jason a closed mouth smile. "Agitated, Saturday's night are always agitated at the hospital," she replied
                                            sadly. I knew her job was not easy. I admired her, I really did. I mean, how couldn't I? She saved lives every day. I was proud of her. She was a good doctor. I squeezed her shoulder. "I know, you should rest.
                                            I will take care of this," I said referring to the bags. My mother gave me a grateful smile. "Alright, I brought you breakfast," she pointed one of the bags. "Thanks God," I muttered. I didn't have to eat Jason's
                                            formless pancakes. "I heard that," Jason glared at me. Mom left us to go upstairs. I really hoped she could have a good sleep. When we were done eating, Jason proceeded to do the dishes. I was sitting next to
                                            the counter as I stared at his profile. His brown hair was all messy, pointing all directions. In that moment, I realized Jason was good-looking in a cute kind of way. He was that type of sweet guy that gets
                                            girls with enchanting words and cute smiles. He rolled his lower lip into his mouth as he kept on his chore. He had nice lips, his lower lip was fuller than his upper one but they looked good. His body was not
                                            slightly muscled like Shane's. Jason was thin but defined. What the hell, Jules! Did I just check out my best friend? That was so inappropriate of me. God, seeing him naked was really affecting me. That thought
                                            brought unwanted images of his thing to my mind. Oh God, I couldn't help blushing. "Why are you blushing?" I jumped to his voice. Jason was now in front of me, drying his hands with a kitchen's rag. I looked
                                            up to meet his green eyes, he was staring down at me, confusion plastered on his face. "I...hum, I'm not blushing," I looked away and stood up. I could feel his eyes on me as I stumbled towards the kitchen's
                                            doorway "I'm going back to my room," I said cowardly as I left him there confused. * * The day rushed by uneventful. Laura had called when she finally got to her house. Apparently, Shane had helped her giving
                                            her some clothes from his little sister. Laura had told her mother she spent the night in my house. However, her mother still grounded her for not notifying her in advance. Jason left as soon as he was done
                                            in the kitchen. I was grateful for it. I really needed him away from a while. This entire seeing-him-naked thing was messing up my mind. I was lazily lying on my couch. It was twilight. The house phone rang
                                            and I answered before the sound could wake up my mother. She seriously needed to rest. "Hello?" "Hello, peachy girl," my breath was caught inside my lungs. My heart started pounding desperately behind my thin
                                            ribs. Act casual, Jules. "He-hey," Did I just stutter? Way to act casual, Jules. "You sound surprised," he teased with that sexy voice of his, sending shivers through my entire body. "Yeah, I wasn't expecting
                                            your call," I admitted clearing my throat. He chuckled. "I'm bored," "You're bored?" I cocked an eyebrow but then felt stupid because he couldn't see "So that's why you're calling me," "Yeah," I swear I could
                                            see him smirking at the other side of the line. I couldn't help visualizing the cute dimples that formed on his cheeks when he smiled "what were you doing?" "Just talking to Laura," I said frankly. Evan knew
                                            she was my best friend. I'd told him everything about her and Jason. Yeah, I wasn't really reserved when it came to him. I just felt like I could trust him, crazy huh? "I read the new chapter for your story,"
                                            he commented all of the sudden. I froze. "Why? I thought you hated that story, you said it was too cheesy," I reminded him as I remembered his mean comment on my story. "I was curious. It's incredible the things
                                            I can learn about you by reading it," "What do you mean?" I frowned. "Nothing," he whispered and a shiver went down my spine. I really needed to reinforce my self-control around Evan. If his voice was doing
                                            this to me, I couldn't even imagine what would happen to me if I see him face to face. This thought reminded me of the fact he didn't want to tell me where he lived. "Evan..." "Don't," his voice grew cold. Did
                                            he know what I was going to ask? "Why can't you just tell me?" "It doesn't matter," "It matters to me," "Why?" he inquired and I swallowed. "Because you're my friend," I slurred the last word. Why did I always
                                            do that? Because you like him, silly. You don't want to be his friend. My inner voice replied to me. "We are miles away, Jules," my stomach fluttered when I heard him say my name. "You already said that, I just
                                            want to know where you live," I insisted. Evan sighed in frustration. "It's better if you don't know," he said seriously. "Why?" "Jules, drop it," "I can't," "Yes, you can and you will," he sounded upset. "Evan,
                                            please," I pleaded. "Why can't you just drop it?" "I..." I trailed off not knowing what to answer. "This is wrong," Evan whispered softly. "What is wrong?" "This," "What are you talking about?" "Jules, I'm not
                                            good. You shouldn't be this eager to know more about me," "I just want to know where you live, that's all," "I know why you want to know," he assured "that's why I'm not telling you," "Evan, you're confusing
                                            me," "I know," I caught a trace of sadness on his tone "I gotta go," "Evan, don't," "I'm sorry," he whispered before hanging up. I placed the phone back on the table and ran my fingers through my hair. What
                                            the hell was that? why did I want to know so bad where he lived? I knew the answer to that question, I knew it. I was just in denial. But there was no point in fooling myself anymore. I really liked Evan. A
                                            lot. It was something more than an internet crush; I was seriously starting to like the guy for real. That's why I wanted to know where he lived because deep down, I hoped I could meet him wherever he was. I
                                            wanted to meet him so bad that it actually scared me. This like for him was growing and growing and I was worried and scared. I'd never liked a guy this much in my entire life. I was scared of getting hurt,
                                            scared of him not liking me back. I mean, I didn't even know if when he said he liked me he meant it as more than a friend. God, I didn't even know where he lived. What if he lived in another country? Wattpad
                                            had members from everywhere. I let myself fall backwards on my couch and stared at the ceiling. It was going to be a long week according to my list of things-to-do: 1.- Find out where Evan lives. 2.- Investigate
                                            if Laura is still a virgin or not. 3.- Try not to see Jason naked again. 4.- Help Shane with Marissa or Merissa whatever her name was. and the most important one: 5.- Find out what the hell is wrong with me.
                                            Why am I developing such strong feelings towards a guy I hadn't seen personally? Yeah, it was going to be a long week. x M W L X A/N: Hello :D I uploaded fast this time. I hope I get a reward! :) I guess, you

                                            You've been warned. Thank you for being the awesome fans you are &lt;3 You made my day with your funny comments and support! My Wattpad Love Chapter 15 I was sitting on a bench at 3:06 am in the middle of the
                                            town's square. Shane was sitting next to me in silence. I was shivering from the cold; my hair was sticky and starchy. My clothes were damp. Vodka, strawberry juice and other unknown substances were enveloping
                                            my upper body. Shane wasn't looking very good either. A dark bruise was forming on his cheekbone; it was probably going to become a black eye very soon. His lower lip was swollen and had a small cut. His shirt
                                            was ripped off at some parts. I know what you're wondering... How the hell did we end up like this? What happened? Alright, I will enlighten you. 12 Hours ago... "I'm so embarrassed," Laura said whilst chewing
                                            some French fries. It was lunch time "I mean, I can't remember a damn thing. There's this huge blank in my mind when I tried to remember that night," I gave her a sympathetic smile. It was Friday already, the
                                            week had rushed by uneventful. I'd talked to Evan everyday but he seemed so distant since last Sunday when I asked about where he lived. "Well, that's the power of alcohol, Lau. It can erase your memory," I
                                            said giving my hamburger a bite. "I'm not a drinker, you know that," she fork-pinched a slice of tomato from her salad "I just wanted to have fun that night and-" "Drink a little but everything went down the
                                            drainage after the first drink," I finished for her. I heard the same statement many times this week. That was all she could talk about, I couldn't blame her though. I knew I would be doing the same-if not worse-
                                            if I was in her position. I knew she had to talk to Jordan sooner or later. It wasn't like she could avoid him forever, I mean, we attended to the same school and he lived down her street. But I could understand
                                            her fear. She was scared of what he could tell her, scared of confirming she'd lost something as special as her virginity in a drunken night. "Have he tried talking to you?" I asked and took a huge bite from
                                            my hamburger and got some French fries in my mouth until it was so filled my cheeks were inflated. It tasted so good, I moaned softly. Laura stared at me like I'd grown a third eye. I gave him a 'what' look.
                                            "I honestly don't know how you're so skinny. I mean, you eat like a pig," I narrowed my eyes at her whilst chewing my food "and to answer your question, if he's tried to talk to me I haven't noticed because
                                            I've been too busy avoiding him," I swallowed my food and opened my mouth to say something. "Julie!" A pitchy familiar female voice screamed from behind me. I lost my appetite and rolled my eyes. It was a good
                                            thing, she couldn't see my face. Reluctantly, I turned half of my body to look behind. There she came... My torture... The definition of hell on earth for me Melissa. Shane's ultimately crush. Remember my task
                                            list? Yeah, I had to make this girl fall for Shane within a week. I owed Shane big time since he'd saved me and Laura. However, I wasn't really succeeding; each time I mentioned Shane to her she would change
                                            the subject. It was like she didn't want to talk about him and I couldn't blame her. I forced a smile as she sat next to me placing her tray beside mine. "Hey, I've been looking for you all day," she said smiling
                                            sweetly at me. Melissa was a sweet girl but she was taking this friendship too seriously. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't that I didn't like her. I just felt terrible for befriending her for such evil purposes
                                            like getting her in Shane's bed. I felt utterly disgusted with myself. Melissa seemed to be a nice girl. She didn't deserve to be used by someone like Jerkpid. "Yeah, I was starving so I practically ran over
                                            here," I lied giving her a closed mouth smile. Laura shook her head disapprovingly. We ate our food in silence. Melissa made a few comments about the paper work she did for Math and bragged about the A she got.
                                            I chuckled remembering Shane had failed that one because of me. His face was priceless. Oh Good times... "Julie?" a hand was waved in front of my face. I snapped out of my flashback moment to find a frowning
                                            Laura. Melissa was gone. "Huh?" "Are you going to eat that? Lunch time is almost over," I looked down at my tray. Half of my hamburger and French fries were still there. When had I stopped eating? I finished
                                            my food quickly "I'll see you in class" Lau waved her hand at me as she walked away,. We were heading out of the cafeteria, my stomach was full. I felt really good. However, my good mood went down the drainage
                                            when I saw who was coming towards our way. Shane Mason... The school's popular player... or how I'd like to call him... The Antichips. That was my original version of the Antichrist since I thought of chips
                                            as a gift from God. Shane was wearing a tight dark t-shirt making his defined arms and chest visible, his hair was messy and his eyes held a glint of smugness as he passed by girls and they almost drooled over
                                            him. Oh God... I have to hide! Without thinking properly, I got inside the nearest janitor's closet. I could hear the commotion vanishing in the outside. Everyone was probably heading to class. I would wait
                                            here for a few minutes and then ran to class. I really hoped Shane was out of the hallway when I come out. The door was swung opened and I jumped away from it before it could hit me. "Jones," Shane greeted stepping
                                            inside and closing the door behind him. A lopsided smirk formed on his lips "Are you hiding from me?" "Me?" I exclaimed exaggeratedly "No, of course not," I shook my head repeatedly. Shane narrowed his eyes
                                            at me. "Yes, you are," he took a step closer. I backed away scared "Why?" "I wasn't... I didn't..." "How is Melissa?" he asked staring at me suspiciously. "All good, the plan is going great," I shouted with
                                            fake a enthusiasm. Shane got closer to me until my back was pressed against the wall. I swallowed. "Really? That's weird because I just asked her out and she turned me down," he explained "so, your plan is not
                                            going so great, is it?" he placed a hand on the wall at the side of my face. His hazel eyes were boring into mine. "I tried, I really tried but she's-" Shane put his index finger over my mouth silencing me.
                                            I shivered at the contact. "You haven't tried hard enough," he retreated his hand and his gaze dropped to my lips. The tension in the room made my heart beat faster "If you fail, you'll be my slave for a night,"
                                            I opened my mouth to protest "no buts, you owe me, Jones," "I'm not gonna have sex with you," I stated firmly. Shane chuckled. "Why is it that you always think that? I don't like you, Jones so I wouldn't have
                                            sex with you even if you were the last girl in the world," His words stung. My hidden ego was wounded. I knew I should feel good about the fact that he didn't want me like that but it still hurt like hell. Shane
                                            managed to make me feel so ugly with just a phrase. Tears sprung to my eyes but I held them back and lifted my chin proudly. "I wouldn't have sex with you even if... even if..." I trailed off not knowing what
                                            to say. Shane laughed and stared at me amused. "Even if?" he cocked an eyebrow and leaned closer to me "That's bullshit, Jones. If I want to, you would be mine a in blink of an eye," "Never," I said in a puff.
                                            "You wanna bet?" "No," I replied seriously. I'd read too many stories about bets on wattpad. The girl always ended up losing, she either got her heart broken or she would live happily ever after with the guy.
                                            With my luck, I knew It would be the first option for me. Happy endings were not my thing. Shane's smirk grew bigger. "You're afraid you'll lose, Jones?" He teased. "No, I ju-" "Then why are you refusing?" He
                                            leaned closer until we were so close our breaths were mixing. I pushed him away from me but he didn't move a muscle "Aww, little Jones is afraid she'll lose, isn't she?" "Back off," I pushed on his chest again.
                                            "Say yes," "No, Shane," I tried to step aside but he placed his hand on my hip keeping me still. "Why not?" He insisted burying his face in my neck. I shivered as his nose made contact with my skin. My breath
                                            quickened. "Shane, stop!" I pushed his chest harder and this time he moved slightly backwards. "Coward," he teased as I approached to the door "wait," he grabbed my arm and spun me around to face him. "What?"
                                            "There's a party tonight in Jordan's house," I folded my arms across my chest. "So?" "You have to take Melissa there. I will take care of the rest," "What? No, I can't do that," "Then I hope you enjoy being
                                            my slave for one night," I let my arms fall to my sides in defeat. "Fine," "You can also take Laura with you," "I don't think so," I stated remembering Laura was avoiding Jordan. She wouldn't go to his house
                                            even if I dragged her there. "Why not?" Shane scowled at me "I thought they were-" "Don't say anything!" I interrupted "I don't want to know," "What are you talking about?" I ignored him and got out of that
                                            janitor's closet. The afternoon rushed by pretty quickly. I didn't pay too much attention to my biology class since I was chatting with Evan. Him: So you gave up on being cupid? He knew everything about Melissa
                                            and Shane. Me: Not yet, but I really suck at this stuff. Melissa doesn't even want to talk about him. Him: haha Mrs. Strawberry sucks at love stuff, how ironic! Me: What do you mean? Him: You're all love and
                                            sweetness. You write cheesy stories but you can't even get two people together. Me: Oh shut up! Him: ;) touched a nerve, peachy girl? Me: Again with the nicknames? Him: Yeah. Me: What are you doing? I asked
                                            trying to get to know more about him. Maybe get him to spit out where he lived by accident or something. Yeah, that was unlikely to happen but a girl can dream, right? Him: I'm writing. Me: really? What are
                                            you writing? Him: A poem. Me: About what? Him: it's a sad poem :) Me: Hmm, those are your favorites? Him: I guess so. Me: Can you show it to me? Him: No. Me: Come on, if you're going to post it on wattpad I
                                            will read it anyway. Him: I'm not going to post it. I frowned. Me: Why not? Him: It's a personal poem. Nobody will read it. Me: wow, so much mystery. Now, I'm curious. At least tell me what is it about? Him:
                                            You. My heart skipped a beat and my breath was caught inside my lungs. Me: me? Him: Yes. Me: You wrote a poem about me? My heart was racing inside my chest. The dragons in my stomach were fluttering desperately.
                                            I bit my lower lip waiting for his answer. Him: Yes. Me: why? Him: Because. His vague answers would always get on my nerves. I was about to type a reply when the bell rang. Groaning, I told him I was heading
                                            to gymnastics and shoved my phone inside my pocket. ** After getting home from school, having dinner and getting ready. Melissa picked me up to get to the famous party. This is not going to end good I thought
                                            as I stood in front of Jordan's door. The music blasting inside was announcing a good party. Melissa was standing next to me. She looked beautiful with her tight flowered dress and cute sandals. I was suddenly
                                            self-conscious. I was wearing my usual baggy jeans and loose t-shirt. My hair was on a messy bun. I wasn't a fan of parties. I only came to bring Melissa otherwise there was no way I was going to come. The door
                                            opened slowly showing a grinning Jordan. He was at least two heads taller than me. He looked really handsome with his disheveled bad boy look. He reminded so much of Shane. His brown eyes looked between Melissa
                                            and me. "Hello there," he grinned at Melissa and she instantly blushed. Bastard! I glared at him folding my arms across my chest "How come I've never seen you before, beautiful," he started getting closer to
                                            my blonde friend. I stepped between them. "Probably because of the big sign that says 'Player' hanging over your face. It blocks your vision, doesn't it?" I said giving him a fake closed mouth smile. Jordan
                                            narrowed his eyes at me. "And who are you?" His flirty voice turned into a cold one. "She's my friend," Melissa intervened wrapping an arm around my shoulder "now, can we get in? It's cold out here," Jordan
                                            hesitated but then stepped aside. "Welcome to my palace," he said with enthusiasm. I watched in disgust how he stared at Melissa's ass as she walked inside. Men were all the same. Shaking my head disapprovingly,
                                            I followed her. I find it quite funny and unbelievable how a party can change in a short period of time. At the beginning, everything was kind of calmed. People were talking and gathering in groups while drinking.
                                            Two hours later? The place was a mess. There were girls dancing on the tables, boys trying to touch them. Couples were making out in dark corners. People kept going upstairs to do God knows what. And me? I was
                                            being squeezed by a bunch of people I didn't even know. I was trying to get through them but Jesus, it was becoming impossible. I really wanted to go home but Melissa was nowhere to be found. I'd let her with
                                            Shane like half and hour ago but I had no idea where they went. So now I was alone and stuck here surrounded by drunken people. I couldn't go home since Melissa was my ride. I would walk to Lau's house since
                                            it wasn't that far but I really didn't want Laura to find out about this. I mean, the entire Jordan's subject was still really touchy for her. I was rudely pushed out of the mass of people and I felt like I
                                            could breathe again. For a moment, I sensed eyes on me. I scanned around the alcohol intoxicated people but found nothing. That was weird. My eyes landed on the stairs and I watched Shane coming down. His shirt
                                            was all messy as was his hair. An arrogant smirk was formed on his lips. He looked... Pleased? As if he had won something... As if... Oh no... Jordan met Shane at the end of the stairs and high five him. And
                                            then everything happened in slow motion... Melissa was coming down stairs fixing her dress when Jordan took some money out of his pocket and handed it to Shane. Uh-oh... Melissa's eyes widened. Hurt and anger
                                            crossed her face as she got between them. "Shane, what the hell is going on?" She inquired glancing at the money on his hand. Shane was out of words. He wasn't expecting this, I could tell. "He won a bet, that's
                                            all, babe," Jordan explained carelessly. "A bet? What was the bet about?" She asked angrily. I felt like I was in a live soap opera. The pop corns were the only thing missing. "You," Jordan stated shrugging
                                            his shoulders. Shane glared at his friend. "Me?" "Yeah, we bet on how long it would take him to have sex with you," alright, I must admit I didn't see that one coming. My jaw dropped to the floor in disbelief.
                                            How could they do that? Melissa's eyes were crystallized with tears. Immediately, I walked to them and slapped Jordan right across his face. He was dumfounded, he cupped his cheek and stared at me in shock.
                                            I turned to Shane who looked oddly guilty. "Jones, I-" I slapped him as well "You are the most disgusting guy I've ever met!" I punched his chest over and over again "you heartless pig! You monster! I hope you
                                            die on your sleep! I hope you get swallowed alive by a toothless Anaconda!" I screamed on his face. Shane didn't even try to stop me. He let me punch him "I can't believe I was part of this! That I helped you!"
                                            "What the hell are you talking about, Julie?" Melissa's voice asked from behind. Before I could say something Jordan opened his big mouth. "She helped him get to you. It was all a plan," he said shoving his
                                            hands inside his pockets. I turned around to face her. I watched how Melissa's face fell and in that exact second I felt like the worst piece of excrement on Earth. I felt horrible. "Melissa, I-" "Is that true?"
                                            Two tears escaped her eyes and my heart sunk in my chest "so this was all a lie? You never wanted to be my friend. It was all part of a stupid bet," her voice broke "I thought you were different, I thought..."
                                            She grasped a plastic glass from the nearby table and poured it down on me. The cold liquid ran down my hair into my face. Ok, I deserved that. She took off ignoring me the entire way I tried to follow her until
                                            Shane grabbed my arm stopping me. "Let her go," he said pulling me deeper inside the house. I slapped his hand. "Don't touch me!" Shane rubbed his temples and looked at me. I could see honest guilt on his face
                                            but that still didn't calm the anger within me. "Stop looking at me like that," he said leaning against the kitchen counter. "Like what?" "Like you want to murder me," "Maybe because I want to murder you! How
                                            could you do that?" "Why are you making such a big deal of this? What were you expecting?" he said annoyed. "I thought you truly liked her! That's why I helped you," "You seem to forget I'm a player, Jones,"
                                            I glared at him "this is what I do, I like a girl, I screw her and then move on to the next one," I shook my head disappointed. "You're unbelievable, you disgust me," I turned on my feet and was ready to leave
                                            that place. I smelled like strawberry and vodka. Shane grabbed my arm turning me to him. "Why are you so surprised?" his hazel eyes looked into my blue ones. "Because..." I trailed off remembering my mother's
                                            words. I promised he's a nice boy behind that arrogant facade, sweetie. Mom was definitely blind. There was no goodness behind that arrogant face. "What?" Shane pressed waiting for my answer. I lifted up my
                                            chin determined and slapped his hand. "Because I thought you were better than this," his eyes widened "I thought there was something good behind that arrogant attitude, but I was wrong," I walked out of the
                                            kitchen, feeling awful. I was crossing the mass of people when someone pulled at my arm. I was dragged to a dark corner. My back crashed into the wall and I came to face a ginger boy. His eyes were red and he
                                            smelled of alcohol. "Why so lonely, babe?" he purred cupping my cheek. I smacked his hand. "Back off," I exclaimed pushing him away. He stumbled backwards chuckling. "I like your eyes," he approached to me,
                                            pressing his body against mine. I grimaced in disgust. "Get off me," he ignored me and pinned my hands above my head against the wall. I struggled but he simply slide his hand under my t-shirt "Stop! Help!"
                                            I screamed but the blasting music seemed to mute my screams for help "Stop!" I shivered in disgust when his tongue licked my neck lustfully. Suddenly, the boy was yanked away from me. "Get your hands off her,"
                                            Shane pushed the boy angrily. I'd never seen him angry before and believe me, he looked scary. And then, it started. An epic fight... Shane was beating up the guy whilst other people wanted to help ginger boy.
                                            It all turned into a big mess. Everyone was fighting, girls were screaming. There were chairs flying around. I couldn't even distinguish Shane in the crowd anymore. The sound of broken glass echoed everywhere.
                                            I guess they found another use for the alcohol bottles. I found my way out of the house and breathed in relief when I stepped on the front yard. I couldn't help being worried about Shane. Even though, he acted
                                            like a jerk tonight, he actually saved me from that ginger boy. It started to drizzle. I looked up at the sky. "Really?" I asked to no one in particular. The cold night breeze made me shiver. This was definitely
                                            not my night. "Jones!" Shane's shout came from behind. I frowned when I watched him running towards me "Run!" "What? Why?" I furrowed my eyebrows in confusion and then I saw a bunch of guys chasing after him.
                                            Shane passed by my side and held my hand, pulling him behind him. We were soon running down the street like crazy people. Drops of rain were hitting my face and the cold was becoming unbearable. Now... That
                                            was how we ended up here. Shane was beaten up and my upper body was damp. It was a good thing my phone was inside my jean's pocket. It didn't get wet. I really sucked at fulfilling my objectives. Remember my
                                            task list? Well, I still didn't know where Evan live, or if Laura was still a virgin or not. Conclusion: I sucked at tasks lists. I glanced at Shane and he was looking at the street absentmindedly. "I think
                                            we should go," I said breaking the silence. Shane was too quiet, which was weird. "Yeah," he replied coldly. He got on his feet and I imitated him. My phone buzzed in my pocket, I got it out and checked the
                                            message. It was a mail from Wattpad. "DarkPoet001 sent you a message" I smiled like a fool and proceed to open the message. "You look cute tonight" I stopped on my tracks. My heart was already hammering inside
                                            my chest, menacing to jump out of my throat. I stopped breathing. How did he... With shaking hands, I started typing a reply. Me: How do you know? Him: Because I saw you ;) ---X M W L X---- A/N: Muahahaha sweet
                                            tempting cliffhanger! Shoot me potatoes again so I can make French fries :D Love, hugs and Evan's strawberries, Arix ;D ******************************************* [16] Chapter 16 *******************************************
                                            Hello! Sorry for the long wait but I'm super busy with my job and I think I got the flu -.- Unedited Chapter! Enjoy &amp; Vote My Wattpad Love Chapter 16 To say I was in shock was an understatement. I was bewildered.
                                            I was frozen. I was not moving or breathing. My eyes were glued to my phone's screen. He saw me. Evan saw me. He just said he saw me. Those phrases kept playing inside my head over and over again. Not to mention...
                                            the questions: How? When? Where? Was he being serious or was it all a joke? Was he at the party? "We're miles away, Jules" his words echoed through my head. I didn't need to be bright to know Evan was lying,
                                            whether he was lying about the fact of us being miles away or the fact that he'd saw me I didn't know but I was going to find out. Me: What do you mean you saw me? I sent the message. My heart was menacing to
                                            jump out of my chest as I waited. Him: ;) Really? That was all he would say? A freaking winking face? I was almost dying of an heart attack here and he just sent me a winky face. Evan could be a jerk sometimes.
                                            Me: Evan, what the hell..? What do you mean you saw me? Him: Because I did. Me: What? How? When? Him: How? With my eyes, when? Tonight ;) Me: You were at the party? Him: Maybe. Me: Maybe? Evan you're confusing
                                            me. I sent that message with shaky fingers. It was then I realized I wasn't feeling so well. My stomach felt funny and it wasn't a nice sensation, believe me. The next thing that happened was the last thing
                                            I was expecting. Hell, I wasn't expecting it at all. I didn't know if it was because I had skipped dinner that night, or because I drank a cup of beer or because all the emotions I'd been through in the last
                                            couple hours. My sight became blurred and my hands cold and sweaty. I felt sick but then my knees gave up as my eyes rolled to the back of my head. I, Julie Ann Jones, passed out in the middle of my town's square.
                                            *** "She's dead," "No, she's not," I was being dragged out of unconsciousness slowly. I could hear two male voices around me, they sounded worried. "How much alcohol did you give her?" "What? I didn't-" "Oh
                                            come on, Shane, look at her," I could feel eyes on me for a moment which made me feel kind of awkward "she's totally wasted," "No, she didn't drink," "Are you sure?" "Hum, no?" What happened... I wondered inside
                                            my head. I was lying on my back on a very soft surface: a bed. Something poked my cheek. "I think she's dead, man," it was then I recognized that voice: Jordan's voice. "She's not dead, she's breathing, you
                                            idiot," Shane sounded closer to me this time. The bed dipped in a spot next to me and I knew Shane was sitting there. Opening my eyes slowly, I met the worried face of Shane. It was the first time I'd seen him
                                            looking so vulnerable. I opened my mouth to say something but then a sharp pain at the back of my head made me moan in pain. "Ow," I exclaimed wincing. "Don't move," Shane demanded holding my hand. "What the
                                            hell happened?" I asked with a sleepy voice. My head was throbbing painfully. "You passed out," Shane said staring at me. "I did?" God, my head hurt so much "My head..." "You hit your head when you fell," Shane
                                            gave me a sympathetic smile. "I-" "Yeah, Shane didn't catch you on time. Smooth, bro, really smooth," Jordan shook his head disapprovingly at Shane. "I tried, alright? But everything happened so fast. Besides,
                                            she didn't even tell me she was feeling sick," Shane retorted. "Guys," "She's really skinny, how hard can it be to catch her?" Jordan folded his arms across his chest. "By the time I turned around she was already
                                            falling," "Guys," "Oh really?" Jordan narrowed his eyes at Shane. "Guys!" I shouted getting their attention. They both snapped their head towards me. "What?" "Could you please be quiet? My head is going to explode,"
                                            I pleaded. They smiled apogetically at me "Thank you, what time is it?" I lost notion of time but by the sunlight streaming through the window I knew it was the morning already. "7:25," Jordan said after glancing
                                            at his watch "Do you want anything? We can take you to the hospital if you want," "No," I sat up rubbing my throbbing forehead "Mom is on duty, she'll freak out if she sees me there," "Jules," I was surprised
                                            by Shane's soft voice. It wasn't everyday he called me by my name. He usually used my last name "I really think we should take you. I mean, you hit your head pretty bad," "Yeah, because your shining knight in
                                            armor couldn't catch you," Jordan chimed in. Shane gave him a annoyed look. "Dude, just drop it," "This is your fault, I haven't slept at all because of this," Jordan stated and yawned. "You mean, you didn't
                                            get laid because of this," Shane shot back. I rolled my eyes. "Stop," I ordered swinging my feet out of bed. My stomach roared and I smiled shyly at the two big guys in front of me "I'm hungry," "Yeah, that's
                                            pretty obvious," Jordan chuckled "I'll get the maid to prepare something for you," he walked out of the room. "Can I use the bathroom?" I asked nervously. Shane nodded and gestured me a half-opened door next
                                            to the drawers. After taking a shower, eating yummy food and changing into Jordan's clothes I could fairly say I was as good as new. I honestly didn't know why I passed out but I would deal with that later.
                                            Right now, I was staring at my phone. It was a good thing Shane had been considered enough to pick it up when I blacked out. I really couldn't afford another phone. My phone had obviously ran out of battery
                                            so I was waiting patiently for it to charge. Ok, maybe not so patiently but I was trying. I was sitting in Jordan's living room. I must admit he had a beautiful house. It was modern. You know, like that type
                                            of house with unusual shaped chairs and leather furniture. There were psychedelic paintings all over the walls. This house was truly bright. "How are you feeling?" Jordan asked as he dropped himself on the couch
                                            across mine. "Good," "That's good," "Yeah," I wasn't really in the mood to talk to Jordan. He'd acted like a jerk last night. he and Shane were horrible to Melissa. Oh, that reminded of the fact that she probably
                                            hated me right now. "Listen," Jordan started awkwardly "Shane told me you're Laura's best friend," "Yeah, I am," I said proudly. "Why is she avoiding me?" for a moment, I saw a glint of sadness in his eyes.
                                            "What do you mean?" I played the fool. "You know what I mean, you're her friend. Girls always tell each other that stuff," "Hum, why do you want to know? I mean, you obviously don't care about her. You were
                                            hitting on anything with boobs last night," I said bitterly. "I just want to know. I'm curious, that's all," he shrugged his shoulders carelessly. "You're just curious?" I rose both eyebrows at him "That's all?"
                                            I pressed staring at him. Jordan shifted uncomfortable on the couch. "I just don't get her," "And that's obviously eating you from the insides," I commented amused "You've never been avoided before, have you?"
                                            "No," I chuckled "it's not funny," he glared at me. "What happened between you two that night?" I had to ask. Mostly because I was curious as hell but also because I seriously needed to achieve some of the goals
                                            in my task list "did you two..." I trailed off awkwardly. Jordan's eyes widened as he realized what I was referring to. "What? No!" "Oh thank God!" I let out a sigh of relief. Lau was still virgin, what a relief!
                                            "Why would you think..." he trailed off scowling at me "did she tell you we-" I shook my head before he could finish that sentence "she doesn't remember, does she?" Jordan's tone grew sadder. "No, she doesn't,"
                                            "She thinks we had sex? That's why she's been avoiding me?" "Not exactly," "Then what is it?" "Well, she wasn't sure about what happened that night," "She was drunk. I would never take advantage of a drunken
                                            girl. I may be a jerk sometimes," I cocked an eyebrow at him "well, most of the times, but I would never go that low. Besides, she's-" he stopped talking abruptly as if he was going to say something he shouldn't.
                                            "She's what?" "Never mind," we heard footsteps and then Shane was joining us. "What's up?" he greeted falling backwards on the couch I was sitting until he was lying over it. His head was resting on my lap.
                                            I glared at him and he gave me a innocent smile. His hair was wet and he smelled of honey shampoo and soap. He'd probably just taken a shower "What were you guys talking about?" he asked curiously. "Get off
                                            my lap," I tried pushing his head off but he wouldn't cooperate. I was still mad at him about last night. "Why so violent, babe?" he purred whilst his hand was going up to caress my cheek. I slapped his hand
                                            away. "Get off or I will stick my fingers in your eyes," I menaced. Jordan snickered. "Hey, I saved you last night, remember? I don't deserve this treatment," he narrowed his eyes at me. I faked a smile. "Of
                                            course, you don't deserve this treatment," I leaned down as if I were to kiss his forehead. He closed his eyes and I took the opportunity to push him off the couch "You deserve worse," "Sh*t!" Shane exclaimed
                                            as he landed on his stomach on the floor. Jordan burst out laughing. "You are something, girl," Jordan gave me a thumb up. "Considering the fact that you let me fall last night, I think we're even," I said to
                                            a very annoyed Shane. He was already standing in front of me massing his stomach. "You are evil," he said aiming his index to me. We spent the rest of the morning chatting and commenting about the party. I barely
                                            spoke to Shane but Jordan was another story. The guy was awesome at telling funny stories and jokes. My stomach hurt from laughing so much. Even though, they both acted like complete jerks the day before I couldn't
                                            help feeling guilty for judging them before getting to know them. They were not as bad as they wanted people to think they were. It was like I was seeing their true selves. Was Mom right? Was the player/jerk
                                            attitude just a mask for them? It made sense. They were probably using it as shield against the world. I mean, if you're a player you don't get attached to anyone so you won't get hurt. God, I felt like I was
                                            thinking this too much. Shane fell asleep on my lap, yeah, I know, I had no idea how he managed to crawl back to me again. Jordan was yawning and said he was going to take a nap. I sighed as I realized I couldn't
                                            move. I had a very snoring Shane on my lap. So, I extended my hand towards my phone and smiled when I noticed it was full charged. The first thing I saw when I turned it on where the several emails I had from
                                            wattpad. I scrolled down to look for one particular username. My stomach did a back flip when I found the mail I was looking for. "DarkPoet_001 sent you a message" I clicked the message opened "I saw you by
                                            accident" Quickly, I started typing a reply. Me: You there? Him: Yeah. Me: So, what was all that about? Him: What? Me: Don't play the fool. You said you saw me last night. Him: Yeah. Me: How? Him: With my eyes?
                                            Me: Evan, be serious. Him: What do you want me to say? Me: I want you to be honest with me. Him: I'm being honest. Me: Then tell me where you live. Him: Jules... Me: I swear to God, that if you leave again and
                                            ignore my question I will never speak to you again. I was tired of him being so secretive. I was tired of being kept in the dark. Evan was all I could think of, he was the first thing I thought about when I
                                            woke up. That wasn't a good sign, was it? Him: I told you we live miles away. Me: That's bullsh*t! How can you say that when you told me you saw me last night? Him: It was an accident. Believe me; I wasn't planning
                                            to see you. Me: What's that supposed to mean? Him: Why are you getting so upset about this? Me: You keep confusing me. It's not fair. I feel like you enjoy playing with my feelings. Him: Feelings? What feelings?
                                            My breath was caught inside my lungs. I shouldn't have said that. Me: Never mind. Just answer my question. Him: Jules, I'm not good. I'm not someone you want to get involved with so drop it. Me: You live here,
                                            don't you? You've been living in my town all this time and never said anything. Him: I can't tell you, Jules. I'm sorry. Me: Why can't you tell me? Him: I just can't. Me: So you're willing to lose me just because
                                            you can't tell me where you live. Him: Yes. That stung. Tears sprung to my eyes but I held them back. Me: Wow... now I see how much you care for me. Him: I never said I cared about you. That was it. I felt he
                                            just stabbed my heart deeply. A tear escaped my left eye and rolled down my cheek until it fell off my chin. Why did it hurt so much? I put my phone away and closed my eyes. I never said I cared about you. Those
                                            hurtful words kept replaying inside my head. My lower lip quivered as tears streamed down my face. Then I felt a soft warm hand cupping my cheek. I opened my eyes slowly, my sight was blurred but I could still
                                            see the handsome face of the Antichips. Shane was sitting up, I didn't even notice when he got off my lap. He looked into my eyes and wiped some of tears away. We didn't say anything. We simply stared into each
                                            other's eyes until he pulled me to him and hugged me tightly. I never expected his arms to be so warm. I never expected to be hugged by Shane Mason but the most unexpected fact was... that it felt so good. x
                                            M W L x A/N: No cliffhanger but sad ending, huh? I'm sick so I'm not going to offer any colorful fruits and vegetables today. Buuuut! I made a facebook group for all those fans who want to share ideas, pictures,

                                            Arix. ******************************************* [17] Chapter 17 ******************************************* My Wattpad Love Chapter 17 If you had said to me that I was going to be crying my eyes out over Shane's
                                            shoulder, I would've laughed at your face. I would've called you crazy because three weeks ago, I was sure as hell that would never happen. Oh well, screw my prediction skills, because right now, that was exactly
                                            what I was doing. The most shocking fact was that I wasn't used to crying in front of people. I mean, not even Jason or Laura had seen me cry before, and here I was, sobbing like a baby in the arms of the school's
                                            popular jerk. Oh, life is truly unpredictable. Shane remained in silence, and I was afraid that he would make fun of me or something. But surprisingly, he kept his mouth shut. Why was I crying, anyway? These
                                            tears made realize how much I cared for Evan. I know it sounds crazy because I'd even seen the guy in real life, but I couldn't help it. I was attached to him; I was used to his good morning messages, his teasing
                                            jokes and arrogant replies. We were so much alike, but at the same time, so different. Evan knew more about me that my own best friend. I trusted him . . . why? That was the question. Why did I trust him? He
                                            was just some guy I met on the internet a month ago. How did he end up becoming part of my life? A part of me? I knew it was my entire fault, how I'd let him in. Therefore, I gave him the power to hurt me like
                                            he was doing right now. I never said I cared about you... His words stung. They were like fuel to the burning fire in my chest. Flashes of his beautiful face came to my mind. I loved his smile, I loved the way
                                            dimples form on his cheeks when he smirked. I was intrigued by the dark pool of his eyes. They held so much mystery. His sexy voice was always present in my mind. I felt like he was playing with me... He'd been
                                            so caring and sweet sometimes. But then he says he never cared about me. That's so contradictory. Is this a game for him? I pulled away from Shane, sniffing and wiping my tears away. My eyes met his and I couldn't
                                            help blushing in embarrassment. "I'm sorry, I-" he put his index on my wet lips, interrupting me. "You don't have to say anything," he whispered and then he did something I'd never expected Shane Mason to do:
                                            he smiled at me. Shane gave me a genuine smile. I'd seen him smirk or smile mockingly, but I never expected him to give me a true smile. "Thank you," I said honestly. He nodded and then got off the couch awkwardly.
                                            "Whoever made you cry," he started looking right into my eyes, "is not worth it." I didn't know what to say and neither did he, so he simply walked upstairs. He knew I didn't want to talk about it, so I appreciated
                                            his consideration. There was a knock on the door. I waited for Shane or Jordan to open it, but they never came so I had to do it. Sighing in frustration, I got on my feet. On my way to the door, I tried to fix
                                            my face a little bit but I knew it was useless. My nose was probably tomato red and my eyes were swollen. I probably looked like protagonist of a soap opera. Okay, that was not a good comparison but well, I'd
                                            never been good with comparisons, if you haven't noticed. I opened the door and the sun hit my eyes mercilessly. I raised my hand to block it and blinked, trying to see something. After having my vampire-reaction-to-the-sun
                                            moment, I could finally see who was standing right there in front of me. My jaw dropped to the floor. "Laura?" I asked shocked. She scowled at me and scanned my clothes. Her eyes narrowed as she clenched her
                                            fists at her sides. It was then I remembered I was wearing Jordan's clothes. Oh, this didn't look good. "It's not what it looks like," I said quickly. Yeah, I know. It was such a clichÃ© phrase. People usually
                                            judge when someone said that but hey, what else can you say when it really isn't what it looks like? "I can't believe this," Laura stated, hurt plastered on her face. "Melissa was right." She took a step backwards.
                                            "Melissa?" I frowned. What did she have to do with any of this? "Lau, listen to me, I-" "Shut up!" her voice cracked. "How could you? You knew how much I like him!" "Lau, I don't know what you're thinking but
                                            you're wrong," I tried to explain. "Am I?" A tear rolled down her cheek, and she wiped it away angrily. "I knew you were hiding something from me!" I couldn't deny that. I was indeed hiding the entire Evan thing
                                            from her but it seemed like she wasn't referring to that. "Don't talk to me ever again," she said through clenched teeth and started walking away. "Laura! Wait!" I chased after her desperately. The ground was
                                            hot due to the intense sun so I was forced to jump over it since I was walking bare feet. "Lau! Wait! Damn it! Ow!" Laura was a good girl but she'd always been very gullible. I knew Melissa had probably poisoned
                                            her mind, telling her God knows what about me. And Laura, being the gullible girl she was, believed her. Let me tell you something: Laura was an excellent runner. No matter how fast I tried to run, no matter
                                            how many trash cans I dodged, I couldn't catch up with her. By the time I reached her house, she already had gone inside and slammed the door closed. I rested my hands on my knees breathing heavily. I was literally
                                            out of breath. "Jules!" I heard a distant scream, and I snapped my head towards the street and spotted Jason's car. He was there, half of his body was leaning over the window. "Get in the car now!" He sounded
                                            desperate. "I can't! I have . . . I have to talk to Laura," I explained, holding my chest. Jeez, I was seriously out of shape. "Get in now! This is an emergency," I scowled at him. "Type Z," he finished looking
                                            alert. Alright, I blamed it on Jason, but as soon as he said emergency, I couldn't help thinking this was about condoms. It was his entire fault that now, I related our emergency code to condoms. Reluctantly,
                                            I walked around his car and jumped into the passenger's seat. As soon as I put my seatbelt on, Jason drove off fast. "What's going on? I swear to God, this is about condoms I will-" "What? No," Jason shook his
                                            head, "Why would you think that?" "Then what is it? Because as far as I remember, Code Z is for a zombie apocalypse," I couldn't help chuckling. Yeah, our emergency codes weren't really realistic. "Really? I
                                            thought that was Z +," Jason retorted confused. "No, Z + is for the zombie apocalypse plus if you've been bitten," "No no... That was Z + 0," I rolled my eyes. "No, Z+ 0 is for an alien invasion!" I argued.
                                            "What? No! That's X +," "Alright! Fine! Can we discuss this later?" I said, exasperated, "Tell me what's going on. What's the emergency?" "Check your phone." "Oh God, tell me already." "Just check your damn
                                            phone!" Jason ordered annoyed. I did as I was told. I had 15 missed calls and 4 texts. They were all from Mom. "Uh-oh," I whispered checking the texts. She was really angry. "She's looking for you. You're lucky
                                            I found you before she did," "Where is she now?" I was starting to panic. "She's in the town. We'll get home and then you'll call her to tell her we were out buying peaches," my heart sank in my chest. Peaches...
                                            Peachy girl... Was everything going to remind me of Evan now? "Jules?" Jason glanced at me. I looked away. "Hum?" "You okay?" "Yeah," As soon as we got to my house, I ran upstairs and changed into shorts and
                                            a simple t-shirt. When I called my mother, she sounded pretty upset so I waited for her in the living room whilst Jason was putting the peaches in the fridge. When Mom arrived, she gave me a lecture about picking
                                            up the phone whenever she called and all that stuff. After her motherly-like speech, she went to bed. She was probably really tired. Jason and I went to my room. I sat on my bed, Indian style. Jason simply stood
                                            there next to the door. "So, now, I want an explanation," he said casually. "What are you talking about?" "Well, you didn't sleep at your house. I found you running like a crazy person in the street, wearing
                                            men's clothes and with a red face which means you've been crying," Jason stated, folding his arms across his chest, "I need an explanation." "It's a long story," "I have all day to listen;" I sighed. "Spit it
                                            out," I told him the entire story, omitting Evan's part. Jason told me he was going to talk to Laura about it to solve everything. Jason could be a man-whore sometimes, but he wasn't stupid. "I understand most
                                            of the situation now," he ran his fingers through his hair, "but you still haven't told me why you were crying," I looked down. Jason sighed and sat next to me. He held my chin forcing me to look up at him.
                                            "You know you can tell me anything, right?" his green eyes shone with honesty. I nodded. "You promise you won't judge?" "I promise," "I met a guy," I started awkwardly. I couldn't believe I was saying this aloud,
                                            "on the internet." "So?" "We talked every day; I told him everything about me. We became friends." "Continue," "I gave him my house phone number." "You what?!" Jason stood up. "Why would you do that, Jules?
                                            He's a stranger," "I'm sorry, I wasn't really thinking. I just trusted him," "How can you trust him? He's someone you met on the internet. You haven't even seen the guy." "I saw him," I retorted. Jason's anger
                                            decreased as he waited for me to continue. "I saw him on Skype." "And?" "The thing is . . ." I trailed off nervously, "I like him. Heck, I'm crazy about him," I admitted, looking away. "You like a guy you haven't
                                            even seen, I mean, face to face?" Jason sounded shocked. "That's..." "Weird, I know. I'm a freak," "No, no, Jules that's not what I meant. It's just . . . not something you see every day," he explained sitting
                                            back next to me. "I know it's weird. You don't have to lie," I gave him a closed mouth smile. "I'm not lying. It's pretty unusual but that doesn't mean it's wrong." he stated, cupping my face gently. "You don't
                                            have to worry about what other people think, Jules. Don't be afraid to be different because being different is what makes you special," his thumb rubbed my cheek softly. "It doesn't matter; he doesn't feel the
                                            same way. He made that cleared yesterday," "Is that why you were crying?" I simply nodded. "So you're going to let him go just like that?" "I don't have a choice." "Yes, you do. Do you honestly believe he doesn't
                                            feel the same way?" "No, I don't know. I'm not sure." "Then don't give up," he kissed my forehead and pulled me to his chest. "Everything will be alright, Jules. I promise." ** Following Jason's advice was harder
                                            than I thought. I think I could easily qualify as a stalker. I had tried talking to Evan multiple times without getting a reply. I posted on his message board on WattPad. I'd sent him private messages but still,
                                            there was no reply. I think I could fairly say that Evan was avoiding me. It was already Tuesday and I hadn't heard from him since last Saturday. As for Laura, she wasn't picking her phone and I hadn't seen
                                            her since I was not attending school this week due to the powerful flu I caught-thanks to the events of last Friday. I was lazily lying over my couch; warm blankets were enveloping my sick body. My nose was
                                            red and stuffed. My laptop was resting on my stomach. I was scrolling down Evan's profile as usual. It had become a habit now that I had nothing to do. My heart dropped when I noticed he'd just replied to some
                                            girl on his message board. He was completely ignoring my messages. I watched how they started flirting shamelessly. Then, the girl made a comment about me: Girl: Who's that girl? She kept posting messages on
                                            here. Evan: I have no idea. Girl: She looks a little bit stalkerish if you ask me. Evan: Hum, yeah. My face flamed up in fury. I opened the private message section and started typing in a rush: "You are such
                                            a coward! I know you're avoiding me because you can't deal with the fact you actually care about me. I thought we were friends, I thought you'd be decent enough not to disrespect me like that in public. I'm
                                            not stalker. I'm your friend. I'm probably the only friend you have after what happened to your parents. Stop being a coward and talk to me, Evan. Please!" I really thought that overloaded message was going
                                            to earn me a reply from him, but it didn't. After watching him flirt with the girl on his profile, I slammed my laptop closed and rubbed my temples. My head hurt and I was really cold. Mom had gone out to pick
                                            up some medicine at the hospital for me. She asked for a few free days to take care of me. That was the advantage of having a doctor as a mother. I had my personal doctor and didn't have to move my lazy ass
                                            to be cured. The house phone rang, it didn't surprise me. Mom kept calling to check on me every five minutes which was a little bit too much. People don't die because of a simple flu. Well, with my luck, I wouldn't
                                            be so sure. "Hello?" I answered with a sleepy voice. "Hey," my heart skipped a beat. My breath was caught inside my small lungs. "Evan?" "Yes," his sexy voice sent shivers through my entire body. I had to lean
                                            against the couch not to fall. "He-hey," I stuttered nervously. "I'm not a coward. What do you want from me?" "I . . ." I was speechless. I hadn't been ready to hear his voice. I hadn't been ready to talk to
                                            him. "You've been leaving tons of messages so let's get this over with. What do you want?" "I just . . ." I swallowed "You just what?" he sounded so cold. "I want to see you," I blurted out all of the sudden.
                                            "Why?" there was curiosity lining his voice now. "I'll make you a deal," I started. My fingers were playing nervously with the phone's cord. "Let's meet up and I promise I will leave you alone after that." He
                                            hesitated. My heart was hammering inside my chest. Please, say yes. "You won't let this go, will you?" "No," "Then, we have a deal." he whispered. A smile crept to my lips. "Meet me on Dawson's park today at
                                            6 pm. I'll be next to the lake," "Okay." "Remember your promise." "Yes," "Alright, I'll see you later then, sweet Jules." x M W L x Yes! Are they going to finally see each other?! There'll be a sneak peak from
                                            the next chapter. I'll post it on the facebook group later. You haven't checked the group? Psst! You're missing out the fun. I'm still sick, people so be considerate with me. Love and smashed yellow carrots,
                                            Arix ******************************************* [18] Chapter 18 ******************************************* Join the facebook group! Thanks for the support, guys. You rock! My Wattpad Love Chapter 18 I was
                                            not ready. I wasn't ready to meet Evan. I knew it but there was no point of return now. I squeezed my sweaty hands whilst I was forcing my feet to move across Dawson's park. My pulse was erratic; I could feel
                                            my heart beats in my ears and throat. A drop of cold sweat rolled down my forehead. I wiped it away quickly. Why was I sweating? It was freaking cold out here. It had probably something to do with the fact that
                                            I was awfully nervous. I was having a hard time trying to breathe properly, mostly because I was sick-therefore; my nose was all stuffed up. I really hoped I wouldn't scare him away. I knew I wasn't hot; I wasn't
                                            even pretty so I wouldn't blame him for running away when he sees me. As I approached to the lake, I realized I felt sick. The eagles in my stomach were fluttering around desperately. I needed to calm down if
                                            I didn't want to vomit all over the recently pruned grass. It wasn't like I had a lot of food in my stomach anyway. The sun was setting down, giving the lake's water a glint of orange. I stopped walking when
                                            I reached the edge of the lake. After a few seconds of hesitation, I finally lifted my gaze and scanned around. There were a few couples sitting around the lake. My body froze when my eyes spotted the tall figure
                                            of a guy. He was standing right across me at the other side of the lake. Evan... My heart skipped a beat. He was there, Evan was actually there. He was leaning casually against a tree, looking careless. He was
                                            wearing dark faded jeans and a black hood. He had his hands inside his jeans' pockets. I swallowed. His deep-black eyes met my blue ones and the world stopped for me. It became hard for me to even breathe. His
                                            gaze was so intense; it held so many untold stories and mysteries. I felt like he was seeing right through me; as if his eyes were piercing my soul even when we were a few meters away, even when the lake was
                                            between us. My lips formed a nervous smile. He simply stared at me, his handsome facial expression unreadable. God, I was going to die of a heart attack before I could even talk to him. Holding my chest, I watched
                                            him walk around the lake as he came towards my direction. The closer he came, the faster my heart pumped blood through my veins. Breathe, Jules, breathe. I chanted inside my head. I didn't want to faint before
                                            I even got the chance to talk to him. Each step he took towards me was painfully slow. The vanishing sunlight brushed half of his face, making his skin look creamy. I felt like this wasn't real. I couldn't believe
                                            I was seeing him. I still remembered his first messages to me on WattPad. I still remembered our first argument. His words... "You're too cute for your good." "Goodnight, sweet Jules." "We're miles away, Jules."
                                            I couldn't believe he was just a few meters away from me. He was really tall that I think, he was even taller than Shane. I'd never felt so self-conscious. I was wearing tight jeans (Yes, shocking, I know.)
                                            and a simple, blue sleeveless t-shirt. My hair was combed at the sides of my face, getting slightly curly at the ends. This wasn't the usual me, but it felt good to look presentable once in a while. Laura had
                                            helped me with this. We fixed things earlier this afternoon and I decided to tell her everything about Evan. Conclusion: My best friend was the reason I looked slightly good right now. Besides, she was my ride
                                            back home after I was done here. She was waiting for me at the parking lot. It was her punishment for believing Melissa's words instead of mine. Getting back to the situation at hand, I watched breathless how
                                            Evan, the mean Dark_Poet001, headed to me. He stopped walking when he was right in front of me. He kept a prudent distance. I swallowed feeling my dry throat. The deep pool of his dark eyes seemed to be devouring
                                            me in a slow, but steady process. His midnight black hair was all messy, falling over his forehead and ears. His full lips formed a simple smile; cute dimples appeared on his cheeks. God, he looked so cute.
                                            "Hi," he said breaking the silence. His sexy voice made my knees go weak. He looked extremely intimidating. I felt like a small mouse in front of a huge tiger. Seeing him in person made me notice the age gap
                                            between us. Evan looked more mature than any of the guys I'd met before; but it wasn't like I met many anyway. You could see he had been through a lot. He was an experienced person. But his face still conserved
                                            that cute childish features that made him look cute in a manly way. My mouth was partly opened; I realized I was staring at him. I looked away clearing my throat. "He-Hey," Great, now I was stuttering. The tension
                                            was so thick a needle couldn't have pierced through it. "I'm here," he tilted his head to the side. "Yes, I can see that." I replied nervously. My eyes were glued to the green grass. Look up, you idiot! My inner
                                            voice yelled at me. "Jules?" To hear him say my name sent shivers through my spine. "Yes?" I bit my lower lip. God, I needed to look at him but I just couldn't. "Are you okay? You look a little pale," there
                                            were both concern and amusement lining his voice. "I'm fine," I said too quickly. He held my chin forcing me to look up. His touch sent jolts of electricity through me. I met his dark eyes and I could see his
                                            smirk now. "I didn't come here to watch you stare at the grass," he joked and pulled his hand away. "I wasn't . . ." I trailed off. "So, what's up?" I started rubbing my sweaty hands against my pants. Evan's
                                            smirk grew bigger, making the dimples in his cheeks more noticeable. "You look like you're going to pass out anytime soon." "I'm fine," I repeated. "Sure." I knew he didn't believe me. He knew he made me nervous
                                            and that somehow gave him power over me. Evan smiled at me and sat down on the grass. I stood there and gazed down at him confused. He glanced at me, "Come on, sit down. I don't bite," he touched the spot next
                                            to him. Was he being nice? Slowly, I sat on the spot next to him but still kept some space between us. We stayed like that for a while. We were staring at the sunset in silence. It was so peaceful here. I couldn't
                                            believe Evan was sitting right next to me. It was surreal. I glanced at him from the corner of my eye. He was focused on the sight in front of him. He was so handsome. I looked away; he didn't need to see me
                                            drooling over him. "Why did you lie to me?" the question left my mouth before I could stop it. I could feel his eyes on me but I kept my gaze on the orange sun. "I didn't lie to you," he replied casually. "You
                                            said we were miles away." "We're miles away, I just didn't specify how many," I looked at him and found him grinning mockingly. "Very clever," I admitted smiling at him. "I told you I was ridiculously hot and
                                            smart." he shrugged his shoulders. His eyes held a glint of an amusement. I was getting more and more comfortable around him. Don't get me wrong, I was still nervous. I was breathing heavily and sweating like
                                            a pig but I was getting used to him. At least, I hadn't passed out. "Getting cocky, aren't we?" I cocked an eyebrow at him. "Yeah," he didn't even deny it. I narrowed my eyes at him. I knew I should've been
                                            mad at him but I just couldn't. He'd been a jerk these past few days but just to have him next to me made me forget everything. Besides, he was being nice now. Was he bipolar or something? "You're truly reckless;
                                            you know that, don't you?" "Why?" I asked genuinely curious. "Meeting a stranger in a park isn't the brightest idea," "You're not a stranger." "I am a stranger for you, Jules," God, my stomach needed to stop
                                            doing the back flip thing whenever he said my name. "You are not a stranger," I repeated each word slowly. "I know you. I know a lot about you." "How can you possibly know I'm not a bad person? I could be a
                                            killer or a rapist, even a thief." "But you're not." "How can you know that?" "I just do. I trust you." His eyes widened. My words caught him out of guard. He shifted uncomfortably on the ground and rolled his
                                            lower lip into his mouth. "You're too naive for your own good." he whispered, staring back at the sunset. "You shouldn't trust me." There was sadness in his voice. I felt the urge to hug him. I didn't know where
                                            that came from but I felt like he needed me. He needed comfort. "Evan . . . I . . ." I extended my hand towards his shoulder. Should I touch him? Should I tell him I liked him? One thing was for sure: this meeting
                                            had only increased my feelings for him. Having him so close to me made me realize how big what I felt for him was. It sounded so crazy but it didn't matter that we hadn't had actual face-to-face conversations
                                            before this one. I felt like I'd known him since forever. Yeah, that was just too cheesy back there, but I'm just being honest. My hand reached his shoulder and I felt him stiffen. For a moment, I thought he
                                            was going to push my hand away, but he didn't. So, I dared to move my hand forwards and caressed his face gently. He closed his eyes. His skin was so soft, my fingers traced down his cheek to his jaw. But then,
                                            his hand grabbed my wrist. "Stop," he ordered, turning to me. He was looking right into my eyes. Slowly, he let go of my wrist and pushed my hand away. "I was just-" "Just stop," he said coldly. I looked down
                                            feeling slightly rejected. I heard him sigh. "I'm sorry." I looked up, surprised. Did he just apologize? "I'm just not used to-never mind, I should probably go now." He got on his feet. I imitated him feeling
                                            extremely sad. It wasn't enough. I needed more. "So this is it?" I asked not bothering to hide the sadness in my tone. I had to tilt my head backwards to look at him. We stared into each other's eyes without
                                            saying anything. I knew this was it. I had to leave him alone after this, I gave him my word. God, it was going to be so hard. Evan's gaze dropped to my lips and my breath quickened. I bit my lower lip nervously.
                                            Kiss me . . . That thought roamed around my mind. His lips looked so inviting, so soft. Evan took a step backwards breaking the moment. "Remember your promise," his words stung. They burnt my beating heart.
                                            "I will." I tried to sound as casual as possible. He nodded and then got his hand inside his pocket. He took a folded paper out and gave it to me. "What's this?" I asked, starting to unfold it. He placed his
                                            hand over mine and squeezed it closed around the paper. "Read it when you get home," he demanded as he let go of my hand. "Bye, Jules," he whispered, getting his hands inside his hood's pockets. He turned on
                                            his feet and started walking away. I was left there in pure confusion and sadness. Should I go after him and tell him how I feel? Should I read the paper? Should I ran to him and kiss him? Feeling romantic,
                                            I decided I would go after him and kiss him. What did I have to lose? Your dignity, my inner voice replied. Ignoring it, I was about to start running when I sneezed loudly. Oh right, I was sick. I couldn't kiss
                                            him like that. He'd probably be disgusted. I mean, who wants someone else's germs? I knew I didn't. What was I thinking? I couldn't just go and press my lips against his. This was the first time we'd seen each
                                            other. He'd think I'm crazy or something like that. Defeated, I turned on my feet and headed towards the parking lot. The ride home was silent; Laura had bombarded me with questions but I simply told her that
                                            I didn't want to talk about it. She seemed to understand because she kept her mouth shut for the rest of the ride. ** I walked inside my room and slammed the door closed behind me. Hurriedly, I took off my shoes
                                            and jumped on the bed sitting Indian style. I proceed to unfold the paper Evan had given to me. His writing was slightly cursive, I proceed to read. It was a poem: The Girl and the Shark. Once upon time, in
                                            the middle of the night A girl and a shark got up to fight. They are so different yet so much alike, He is hopelessly doomed, Whilst she glows and shines. She walks gracefully in the dark, Ignoring the constant
                                            danger, Oblivious to the watching Shark. She dances around bringing joy and smiles To those pained hearts She considers worthwhile. She believes in soul mates, She believes in love, But the cruel truth is She
                                            doesn't have any of those. The awaiting shark has lost his soul, He stupidly thinks She can fill the hole. That empty hole in his chest, It swallows everything, Even his own blood and flesh. The pain had made
                                            him numb, Turning him into a cold monster, One that doesn't deserve love. Hurtful words have stamped his spirit. Scars have marked his body, Salvation is inaccessible to him He is just a nobody. The girl and
                                            the shark must stay apart, Because he will not wound Her precious kind heart - Evan. I stared at the paper in shock. I didn't need to be a genius to know that he was The Shark and I was the girl. At the end
                                            of the page, there was a drawing. It was a cute small strawberry; there were a few words written next to it: "You're beautiful :)" X M W L X A/N: Nothing to say.... *******************************************

                                            to find it :D Thanks as usual for the great support. You're all in my heart (Yeah, I have a big heart, problem?) My Wattpad Love Chapter 19 I was seriously questioning my morals. Keeping a promise had never
                                            felt so impossible in my entire life; not even when I promised Mom, I wouldn't play with her shoes when I was seven. Yeah, that had been a tough promise to keep, believe me. I was sitting on my bed; my laptop
                                            was on my lap. I was scrolling down Wikipedia. I was focused on reading an specific term: Morality (from the Latin moralitas "manner, character, proper behavior") is the differentiation of intentions, decisions,
                                            and actions between those that are good (or right) and those that are bad (or wrong). Right and wrong... There was such a thin line between those two. I knew it was wrong to break a promise but God, it was getting
                                            so hard. It'd been two days since the day I met Evan in the park. Two long agonizing days... I'd been at home trying to recover from the so opportune flu I'd caught last week. I read Evan's poem over and over
                                            again. How could he expect me to forget about him just like that? He wrote me a freaking heartbreaking poem and then he expected me just to forget him? He certainly didn't know me well. I wasn't the type of
                                            girl to give up so easily. But then there was the fact that I'd given him my word. However, my word didn't seem too valuable for me right now. Maybe, I could talk to him and blame it on the cough medicine. That
                                            thing was strong; it got me all sleepy and relaxed. I could tell him I got an overdose or something. Yeah, Julie, cough medicine overdose... classy. Sighing in frustration, I closed the Wikipedia tab and immediately
                                            the browser showed me Wattpad. I'd got many privates messages but any of them was from Evan. Not being able to hold back any longer, I clicked on Evan's profile. I wasn't going to talk to him; I was just going
                                            to check his profile, that wasn't bad, was it? As soon as I scroll down his message board, I knew this was a bad idea. He was talking to that girl again. My heart sank in my chest as I watched them flirt. Didn't
                                            he know how bad he was hurting me? If he was going to flirt with her, couldn't just he do it through private messages? It was like he was rubbing all this on my face. I slammed my laptop closed and fell backwards
                                            on my bed. I stared at the ceiling in silence. "What should I do?" I wondered aloud, rubbing my face. I closed my eyes remembering him. I would never forget his face; Evan was not only the hottest guy I'd ever
                                            seen. He had that mysterious sexy aura around him, it pulled me towards me. I felt like I wanted to unveil all his secrets, I knew he was suffering. I saw the hidden pain in his deep-dark eyes. But he'd chosen
                                            to push me away. He'd chosen to be all alone in this. Why? I knew he had a bad past. His parents' death must've been traumatic for him. Was that why he didn't want me around? The Girl and the Shark... His poem
                                            really got to my heart. His words seemed to come to life whenever I read it. My chain of thoughts was interrupted by a much unexpected song. "Dirty babe, you see these shackles. Baby I'm your slave," I snapped
                                            my eyes opened and sat up in shock. The song was coming from my phone, I scowled at it "I'll let you whip me if I misbehave. It's just that no one makes me feel this way," What the hell...? I'd never liked Justin
                                            Timberlake's music. How on Earth did that song end up in my phone? I picked up my phone and everything made sense when I saw the caller ID: Jerkpid "Seriously?" I answered annoyed. Shane laughed at the other
                                            side of the line. "You like our song, babe?" "How the hell did you-ah, never mind." I shook my head disapprovingly. "It's a good song, admit it. It really suits us, you know." "Us? There's no us." "Someone's
                                            grumpy," Shane chuckled. "What do you want?" I asked bothered. It was then I noticed the voices in the background. "We just got out of school and decided to visit the sick puppy." "We?" "Hey, Jules!" I heard
                                            a scream in the background "We're coming over!" "Is that Laura?" I asked surprised. "Yeah," "Who else is with you?" "Jordan. Listen, the reason-" "Wait wait... slow down," I demanded confused "Laura and Jordan
                                            are together?" "Hum, yeah," "Since when?" Jesus, I missed school for a week and everyone decided to make the big choices in my absence. "Since yesterday?" Shane answered hesitantly "I'm not sure but listen-"
                                            "She didn't tell me a thing. How could she?" "Could you please just shut up? I'm trying to say something here." Shane exclaimed annoyed. "Fine, what is it?" "Is there anything you want? We're going to the grocery
                                            store first to get you apple juice and sick people's stuff..." "Sick people's stuff? Really?" I couldn't help chuckling. Shane sighed in frustration as he waited "Hum, I want Ruffles." I said without hesitation.
                                            "I already knew that," he stated arrogantly "You're really predictable." I rolled my eyes. "Well, then get me some gumdrops." "Gumdrops!" Shane shouted to someone "See ya in a few minutes, babe." "Stop calling
                                            me-" he hung up before I could finish, such a gentleman! Wait... They're coming over... and I looked like the drown version of a mutilated zombie. Wow, my comparison skills truly sucked. I jumped out of bed
                                            and headed to the bathroom. As soon as I faced the mirror, I knew I was a lost cause. My hair was knotty and greasy. My nose and cheeks were flaming red, my eyes looked dull and my lips dry. I washed my face
                                            and got my hair in a bun. I changed into a pair of shorts and a sleeveless loose t-shirt. I sat back down on my bed to wait for the guys. I realized the surrealism of this situation. How was it that Lau and
                                            I end up being friends with the school's players? Jeez, this sounded like a wattpad clichÃ© story. You know, where the average girls get close to the popular boys just out of the blue. The only difference was
                                            that I wasn't interested on Shane, was I? I pushed that thought away. The bell rang and jumped out of bed. Did they arrive already? That was fast, well, Shane drove like a crazy fast and furious driver, so it
                                            wasn't really shocking. I was walking downstairs when I heard the bell again. "I'm coming!" I shouted walking faster. Jeez, I was sick. It wasn't like I could fly to the door. Insensitive bastards! I grasped
                                            the doorknob and pulled the door opened. Holy Mother of Ruffles! The whole world stopped for me. My jaw almost dropped to the floor. "You," I said in an almost inaudible whisper. I was positive I wasn't breathing,
                                            hell, I wasn't even sure my heart was beating. I squeezed the doorknob in shock. Evan... Evan was standing right in front of me. This had to be a dream. Oh no... the cough medicine was truly affecting me. Was
                                            I having an overdose? but, I was sure I had taken the right quantity. I frowned trying to remember how much cough medicine I'd taken. What if it was expired? That could cause hallucinations, right? "Jules?"
                                            His sexy voice made my heart beat faster. He was there, he was right there, looking absolutely adorable. A sad expression was plastered on his handsome face. His dark hair was even messier than the last time
                                            I'd seen him as if he had ran his fingers through it too many times. His deep-black eyes stared at me in silence. He was wearing dark-blue jeans and a blue hoddie. "What... are you do-doing here?" I stuttered
                                            swallowing hard. "I just..." he trailed off scratching the back of his head "This was a bad idea," he stated turning on his feet. He started walking away, there was a car parked in front of my house. It was
                                            probably his. Wait... He was walking away... Hell no, I wasn't going to let him go this time. I ran to him and before I could think properly, I wrapped my arms around him from behind. He froze whilst I was hugging
                                            him tightly. I buried my face in his back. He smelled so nice. It was a combination of lavender softener and a light cologne. "Don't go," I mumbled pathetically. Evan's stiff body relaxed a little. I could feel
                                            the beats of his heart. God, it was beating so fast. Was it for me? "I miss you." I heard him whisper so weakly I'd barely caught it. My heart melted at his words. "I missed you too." I replied frankly. Evan
                                            placed his hands on mine to pull them away from him. I let my hands fall to my sides as he turned to face me. We stared into each other's eyes intently. "I hope we can be friends," he stated, his face turned
                                            into a cold expression. I scowled at him. "Friends?" I asked hurt. I liked him, I was crazy about him and he was asking me to be his friend? "Yes." he said casually. "I guess we can be friends even though I-"
                                            he pressed his index finger against my lips. "Friends." he repeated the word silencing me. His finger caressed my lower lip softly causing me to shiver and close my eyes. I felt him lean forwards; his forehead
                                            touched mine "My friendship, that's all I can offer, Jules. Take it or leave it." his breath fanned my lips teasingly. God, if he wanted me to be his friend he seriously needed to back away now. I was struggling
                                            not to move forward and plant my lips against his. I opened my eyes slowly and looked in the depth of his. "I'll take it," he knew I would take it. I would do anything to stay close to him. I had no idea how
                                            I ended up feeling this strong towards him. It was like it was meant to be, as if I was meant to be with him. Maybe I was crazy; I'd never been a regular person. Untold love stories and cheesy novels were always
                                            in my mind. I'd always had the hope of finding the right guy for me. I didn't know if that guy was Evan but a part of me knew he needed me. Evan needed a friend. I knew it was going to be hard-if not impossible
                                            to be this close to him without spitting out my feelings but I had to try. "Good." he said taking a step backwards. He smiled brightly at me. his adorable dimples formed in his cheeks. I couldn't help returning
                                            the smile even though I felt sad in the inside. A cold breeze brushed my skin. I rubbed my arms and sat on the front stairs. Evan imitated my movements and sat next to me "How are you?" he sounded concerned.
                                            "Surviving, this damn flu is killing me slowly and painfully," Evan chuckled. "You're so dramatic." "It's true." "Yeah, right," he rolled his eyes and shook his head disapprovingly "Look at the bright side,
                                            you didn't have to go school." "I missed all the fun. Jordan and Laura got together and I was the last to know." I almost pouted. "It was about damn time they got together." Evan commented starting to take his
                                            hoodie off. "What are you doing?" I asked confused. I couldn't help blushing when his bare arms came on sight. He was left with a black t-shirt. It was then I noticed a dark tattoo on the right side of his neck.
                                            It was a very strange design but it was beautiful, it had the right curves ending close to his jaw "You have a tattoo?" "Yeah, put it on." he said offering his hoodie to me. I scowled at him "I know you're cold.
                                            You shouldn't be out of the house so put it on." he insisted. Reluctantly, I grabbed his hoddie and pulled it over my head. It was too big for me but it was warm and it smelled of him. God, it smelled so good.
                                            Trying not to sniff on the hoodie and look freaky, I focused my eyes on the tattoo. "You never told me you have a tattoo" I couldn't help staring at his neck. "You never told me you didn't water your flowers,"
                                            he stated pointing the dead stiff flowers in front of us "There are many things we haven't told each other," he glanced at me, grinning amused. I couldn't help laughing a little. "How do you know where I live,
                                            stalker?" I said folding my arms across my chest. "Jason told me." Evan shrugged his shoulders. "Jason?" I asked shocked "You know him?" "Yeah, we're sort of friends." "But he's never mentioned you before,"
                                            "I said 'sort of' he's dating my sister." "What?" As far as I knew, Jason wasn't dating anyone. he was only banging Helen... oh no... "Helen is your sister?" "You know her?" he looked at me and I looked away.
                                            I couldn't tell him Jason was actually using her sister just for sex. Jason could be a manwhore sometimes but he was my best friend, I didn't want him dead. "Yeah, he's mentioned her before." I mumbled "So you've
                                            been living here all this time, how come I've never seen you before?" I needed to change the subject. "I don't live here. I live in River Town." "Oh" River town was a close town. It was probably 30 minutes away
                                            from here "but Helen lives here." I stated confused. "She lives with our Aunt. I live by myself in our parents' house." his tone grew colder. He probably didn't want to talk about his parents. "I see." we stayed
                                            in silence for a moment. "Did you like the poem?" he asked softly. I looked up at him, my cheeks tainted red. "Yes, it was really good." I admitted frankly. He smirked at me. "Of course, it was. I wrote it."
                                            he said arrogantly. I chuckled shaking my head. "I forgot about your big ego." I poked his arm. "Ow! Say no to violence, woman." "I was just checking if I could pierce through your ego, you know." I teased smirking.
                                            "Is that so?" He cocked an eyebrow. He gave me a devilish smile and started poking my stomach. I was really ticklish so I started laughing until there were tears streaming down my face. "Stop!" I begged among
                                            laughter. My belly was starting to hurt. I tried to push him away but he wrapped an arm around my waist pulling me closer to him. I couldn't breathe, oh God, I was going to die of laughter, literally. He stopped
                                            and it was then I noticed how close we were. His nose was almost touching mine as he breathed heavily on my lips. Evan's gaze dropped to my mouth and I bit my lower lip in anticipation. A horn interrupted our
                                            moment; we both got away from each other and snapped our heads to the street. A very excited Laura jumped out of Shane's SUV, followed by Jordan. Shane was the last one to get out of the car. I remained unmoving
                                            as I watched my friends coming closer. Confusion and curiosity plastered on their faces as they looked between me and Evan. I smiled shyly at them. It was going to be a long night. X M W L X A/N: Awesome fruits
                                            for everyone! The check is on me. I'm still sick, I shouldn't be writing but I couldn't let you guys wait any longer. Hope you enjoyed the chapter. Muahahahaha *cough* ah, damn cough, it doesn't even let me

                                            certainly going to break a record or something. Well, I was about to have what I'd like to define the most awkward moment of my life. As Laura, Jordan and Shane walked towards me and Evan, I had no idea of what
                                            to say or how to say it. My brain didn't seem to process the situation. Maybe, the cough medicine syrup did have an effect on me. Whatever the reason for my frozen state was, it didn't matter at the moment.
                                            Laura was the first one to get to us. She was smiling knowingly. "Hey," she greeted. Evan stood up and I did the same. Jordan reached Lau from behind and wrapped his arms around her waist. He rested his chin
                                            on her shoulder. "Hey, sick puppy," Jordan said grinning at me but then his grin vanished when he looked at Evan. Shane was the last to come closer. His hands were full of bags. His face was unreadable. It was
                                            like a mask of coldness was covering his face. I mean, Shane always had that arrogant playful attitude since the very first day we started talking but right now, his face was just blank. No trace of playfulness
                                            not even arrogance were on it. I scowled at him but he simply stopped walking once he was next to Jordan and Lau. That was how the awkward silence began. What wasn't I saying something? Everyone was waiting
                                            for me to introduce Evan and I was standing there like an idiot. Laura made me a gesture to speak. "Jules?" She called my name and that seemed to snap me out of my trance. "Ugh, guys, this is... hum..." I trailed
                                            off nervously. Everyone was staring at me expectantly. Awkward moment when your real friends meet your online friend... Laura raised an eyebrow waiting for me to continue. "I'm Evan." Evan spoke for me. He shook
                                            Jordan's hand. "Jordan," "Shane," "I'm Laura, nice to meet you, Evan." Laura said his name slowly flashing amused smiles at me. "What are you doing outside?" Shane asked coldly. I opened my mouth to speak but
                                            he continued "You're sick. You shouldn't be out in the cold." I knew he was right. "Let's get inside." Laura agreed. "I should probably go now," Evan whispered to me. I knew he wasn't comfortable. "No, don't
                                            go." Laure intervened grinning like a cat "We're going to watch a movie. You should stay. There are enough snacks for everyone." Her excitement was contagious. "Yeah," Jordan agreed as he started walking towards
                                            the door holding Lau's hand. When he passed Evan, I heard him whisper "don't eat the Ruffles though, she'll kill you." He pointed me mocking fear. "Very funny, Jordan," I rolled my eyes. After getting our frozen
                                            butts inside the house, Jordan and Lau sat on the big couch. Evan sat on the other couch shyly. Shane took the bags to the kitchen. I hesitated, not knowing where I should sit. Evan was rubbing his hands over
                                            his lap, he was probably feeling out of place. I was about to sit next to him when a hand was wrapped around my arm. "I need your help in the kitchen," Shane muttered and dragged me out of the living room, almost
                                            literally. It was getting hard to follow his pace. As soon as we entered the kitchen, he pushed me inside roughly. His hazel eyes were blazing with anger. His jaw tensed. I'd never seen Shane angry before, it
                                            kind of scared me. "Hey!" I whined rubbing my arm "What's your problem?" "You. You are my problem," he said stalking towards me. I backed away until my back met the fridge. "What are you talking about?" I frowned
                                            confused. Shane passed his hand over my shoulder and pressed it against the fridge. "Who the hell is that freak?" I knew he referred to Evan. "His name is Evan and he's not a freak." I stated offended. Shane
                                            laughed bitterly. "That's the guy from wattpad, isn't he?" "How do you know-" "You're truly reckless, Jones. You let a stranger visit you while you're alone in your house." "He's not a stranger. He's my friend."
                                            I didn't like the tone Shane was using. "He is a stranger," he repeated slowly "are you out of your mind?" Shane definitely knew how to push my buttons "He's the reason you were crying the other day, isn't he?"
                                            I kept my mouth shut but my silence said everything "Wow," Shane shook his head taking a step backwards "you like him." It was not a question. "Why are you getting so upset about this?" I asked him folding my
                                            arms across my chest. My eyes widened in realization "Are you jealous?" Shane laughed. "Why would I be jealous?" he asked amused. He walked towards me once again cornering against the fridge. "I don't know.
                                            You're acting like a jealous boyfriend right now," I placed my hands on his chest trying to push him away but he only grabbed my wrists holding them in the air. His eyes looked right into mine. "I'm not jealous."
                                            He said leaning forwards "If I wanted you, I would've had you a long time ago." "Yeah right," I rolled my eyes. "It would be so easy to seduce you," his gaze dropped to my lips "to please that virgin body of
                                            yours." "How do you know I'm a virgin?" I swallowed. "It's written all over your face." He smirked at me. "They're waiting for us. Let me go." "I make you nervous," he said satisfied "That's a start." He let
                                            me go. I stared at him confused for a moment before running off the kitchen with one of the bags. When I got back to the living room, Laura was sitting on the floor staring at some movies covers displayed in
                                            front of her. Jordan was telling her which one to pick. Evan was in the same position I'd left him. I couldn't believe he was actually there. I sat next to him, he smiled at me. "Welcome back," his smile grew
                                            bigger, the cute dimples formed on his cheeks. My heat skipped a beat. "Miss me?" I teased returning the smile. His dark eyes locked with mine as he replied, "Always," the sincerity in his sexy voice made the
                                            dragons inside my stomach flutter. My eyes landed on his lips, they looked so full and wet. I bet my Ruffles he was a good kisser. Sadness filled me when I realized I would never find out if he was a good kisser
                                            or not. He wanted to be my friend and last time I checked friends don't kiss each other. I looked away from him, it was enough temptation to have him so close to me. "So," I stated getting Lau's attention "What
                                            are we watching?" "Dawn of the bloody mutilated zombies," Jordan joked. I chuckled. "I don't know. There are so many, I want to watch them all," Laura whined pouting. Yeah, did I mention my best friend have
                                            an obsession with movies? She even wants to be a film director when she finishes high school. "Did you pick a movie already?" Shane joined us sitting next to Jordan. Lau shook her head frustrated. "We should
                                            probably vote," Evan chimed in surprising us all. We all stared at him, it was the first time he was actually interacting with my friends "You know, the movie with more votes wins." "That's a good idea, man,"
                                            Jordan nodded his head. "Alright," I clapped my hands excitedly "Our options?" I asked Laura. "Well, we have..." she trailed off scanning the movies "Kiss me now," she showed the first movie, Oh the irony...
                                            "We also have 'Dawn of the zombies' 'Friends with Benefits' and 'Seduce me'" "Why are there so many romantic movies?" Shane asked annoyed turning to Jordan "I thought you were going to pick the movies at the
                                            store," "Hum, well, she..." Jordan looked at Laura "it's hard to say no to her, you know." "Arg, man, you're whipped." Shane shook his head disapprovingly. We all laughed a little at Jordan. "Time to vote,"
                                            I shouted grinning. "Dawn of the Zombies," Shane and Jordan said at the same time. "So predictable," Lau rolled her eyes "I vote for 'Friends with benefits'" she glanced at me and winked. I really didn't want
                                            to watch a zombie movie. To be honest, I didn't have a strong stomach. Show me too much blood and guts and you'll probably see me puking. "Friends with Benefits," I voted hesitantly. We all snapped our head
                                            towards Evan. "It's up to you," Laura waited for him to reply. Each movie had two votes, the choice was up to Evan. Jordan started mouthing 'Choose the zombie one' to him. "Jordan! Stop! He needs to choose by
                                            himself," I said looking at Evan. He seemed unsure of what to say. Please, say Friends with Benefits, please. I pleaded mentally. Evan looked at me and smiled. "Friends with benefits," he said loudly. "Yes!"
                                            Lau jumped to her feet and started doing some weird happy dance "Take that, zombie sucker!" she stuck her tongue out to Jordan. "Dude, what the fuck?" Jordan complained shaking his head at Evan. "It's hard to
                                            say no to her," Evan replied pinching my cheek. My heart melt in my chest, I was sure I wasn't breathing. I couldn't help blushing fiercely. I cleared my throat. "So, let's watch it," I tried to cover my flushed
                                            cheeks but I probably looked like a tomato. I could feel eyes on me; I lifted my gaze to find Shane. He was staring intently at me. "We need to get the snacks out of the bag," Shane gestured the bag I was holding
                                            "Come on, Jones. We all know you want to kidnap the Ruffles but there's enough for everyone." I narrowed my eyes at him. "I thought they were all for me," I retorted holding the bag tightly. "There are live
                                            five huge bag of Ruffles there," Jordan chimed in "come on, share." I sighed in defeat. "Fine, one bag for you." I threw a bag at him. Jordan caught it in mid-air. I heard Evan chuckled next to me. I glanced
                                            at him. "You never told me you have an obsession with Ruffles," he commented amused. "I thought we agreed there were many things we haven't told each other," I used his own words against him. I stole a glance
                                            at his tattoo and he nodded knowingly. "You got me there." He admitted rolling his lower lip into his mouth. Didn't he know he was provoking me by doing that? "Time for the movie!" Lau shout excitedly. We all
                                            got on our seats. Reluctantly, Shane sat next to the lovey-dovey couple. Lau turned the lights off and started the movie. As soon as we were surrounded by darkness, I felt extremely uneasy. Evan was mere inches
                                            away from me. I could see him from the corner of my eye. Calm down, breathe. I chanted inside my head trying to ease my heart beats. We watched the first minutes of the movie in silence, of course, we would
                                            make a few comments once in a while. But then it happened: a sex scene. The main characters started kissing and moving towards the bed. My face flamed up in embarrassment, my ears felt hot. Evan shifted uncomfortable
                                            next to me. "Wow, nice choice, girls." Shane teased grinning. I looked at Lau, her mouth was hanging opened. Don't get me wrong, we were virgins and this wasn't the first time we'd seen a sex scene. The thing
                                            was, this was the first time we watched a sex scene with three guys in the same room with us. Awkward moments: 2 for the night. I was certainly breaking a record. My heart was hammering inside my chest; my hand
                                            was resting next to my thigh. I froze when I felt Evan's hand holding mine. I looked at him and he seemed focused on the movie. What was he doing? He squeezed my hand gently and I felt like I was going to pass
                                            out right there. My hand was getting sweaty, was he noticing that? The scene got even more intense, the girl was moaning loudly. Alright, that was my key to escape. "I'm going to the bathroom," I excused myself
                                            poorly. Lau snapped her head towards me; she stared at me with pleading eyes. I mouthed 'Sorry' to her and escaped the situation. I entered the bathroom, closed the door and moved towards the mirror. I rubbed
                                            my sweaty hands over my face. How could I lie? Masking my feelings was going to be harder than I thought. But I knew I needed to swallow everything I felt for Evan if I wanted to keep him around. It was kind
                                            of masochist if you ask me. It was like having your favorite food in front of you without being able to even taste it. There was so much mystery behind Evan's eyes. What did I have this urge to conform him?
                                            I sighed leaning forwards; I pressed my forehead against the mirror and closed my eyes. Immediately, his face displayed in my mind. He looked so cute when he smiled. There was something in the way he looked
                                            at me that made me feel nervous but good at the same time. "What should I do?" I wondered aloud. "Kiss him," I snapped my eyes opened. My best friend smiled at me through the mirror's reflection. She was behind
                                            me. "I can't." "Why not? God, he's hot!" Lau exclaimed dreamily. "He wants us to be friends," I whispered sadly. "Then friends with benefits it is!" "No!" "Oh come on, the movie is like this huge signal from
                                            God. You two need to hook up," she aimed a finger at me. "Speaking of hook ups," I turned to her "How come I'm the last one to know you and Jordan are together now?" I placed my hands on my hips. Laura bit her
                                            lower lip, guilty plastered on her face. "Sorry about that; everything happened so fast and you were sick so I-" "Excuses, excuses," I interrupted her. "This isn't about me." She retorted "This is about you
                                            and mysterious boy out there." "There's nothing to say," I shrugged my shoulders. "You're crazy about him, just kiss him." "He doesn't like me like that," "Are you serious?" Lau asked in a puff "Can't you see
                                            the way he looks at you? He totally has the hots for you," "You need to stop hanging out with Shane and Jordan. You're getting their phrases," I commented seriously "anyway; nothing is going to happen between
                                            Evan and me." "You wanna bet?" Lau cocked an eyebrow "It's a matter of time. He can't hold himself back forever, neither can you. Your self-control will crack, trust me." I looked down playing with my fingers.
                                            "I just... I don't want to risk everything for a kiss. What if I kiss him and he rejects me? Being his friend is better than nothing," Lau wrapped her arms around me pulling me into a hug. "You're a great girl,
                                            Jules. He's stupid if he can't see that." She kissed my hair. "You only say that because you're my best friend," I stated pulling away from her. Lau smiled at me. "Probably," she teased pinching my nose which
                                            was a terrible mistake. Remember I'd caught the flu? Her fingers were instantly filled with mucus "Ew!" Lau exclaimed washing her hand in the sink whilst I was laughing my ass off. We got back to the living
                                            room. The boys seemed to be chatting about some band. "We're back," Lau informed sitting on Jordan's lap. Evan was using his phone. He put back in his pocket when I sat back next to him. As soon as the movie
                                            started again, I thanked God the sex scene was over. The movie was about to be over when I felt Evan get closer to me until his breath was brushing my ear. I swallowed. "I have to go now," his sexy voice and
                                            hot breath fanned my ear sending shivers through my already revolted body. "Hum, I-I... okay." I finished embarrassed. I hated stuttering. "Guys, Evan has to go. I'll walk him to the door." I informed getting
                                            off the couch. Lau mouthed 'Kiss him!' to me. I glared at her. They all waved their hands to Evan as we started our way to the door. We stepped out of the house. "So," he started looking at me "I had fun." "Me
                                            too." I admitted nervously. "It's a shame I have to go but it's late and I have to drive back home." "I understand," my heart was going to jump out of my chest. I realized I was still wearing his hoodie "I should
                                            probably get this back to you," I said starting to take it off. Evan grabbed my hands stopping me. His touch sent a tingling sensation through me. "Keep it," he said softly. I looked up at him. He was smiling
                                            sweetly at me. I found myself lost in the depth of his eyes. "Evan, I..." Tell him! Kiss him! Do something! "Yes?" he stared at me in silence. "I..." my throat was dry. One of his hands cupped my cheek. I couldn't
                                            help closing my eyes and pressing my face against his hand. His touch felt so good, so right. I felt him lean forward. Was he going to kiss me? Oh God! Did my breath smell? Was I going to give him the flu? I
                                            stopped breathing. He pressed his warm lips against my cheek and then backed away breaking all contact between us. I opened my eyes disappointed. I forced a smile trying to cover up my disappointment. "I'm glad
                                            you agreed to be my friend," he said walking backwards. "Yeah, yay me! " I truly sucked at pretending to be okay. Evan gave me one last smile before turning on his feet and getting in his car. I watched him
                                            leave; my heart was falling inside my chest. God, this was going to be harder than I thought. I got inside the house and let myself fall on the couch. My phone buzzed in my pocket. I checked the e-mail, it was
                                            from Wattpad. Dark_poet001 sent you a message. I frowned as I clicked the message opened: "My hoodie looks good on you. Night, cute Jules." X M W L X A/N: Jules had a busy night, didn't she? Anyway, I wanted
                                            to thank you guys for being the awesome fans you are. I got all your messages wishing for me to get better. It meant a lot to me, especially when I was sneezing and coughing my ass off wishing for a quick death.
                                            I'm not completely healed but I'm definitely feeling better. I'm eating strawberries now oh the irony! Love and pink oranges! Arix. ******************************************* [21] Chapter 21 *******************************************
                                            Unedited chapter! This story will be edited when I finished it because right now, I really don't have time to do it! Facebook group on External link &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ~You're the antidote that gets me by ~ Something
                                            strong like a drug that gets me high~ My Wattpad Love Chapter 21 "You're a chicken!" "I' m not!" "Yes, you are" "I'm not!" I repeated annoyed. Laura hadn't stopped teasing me about the entire Evan thing. According
                                            to her, I was a hopeless coward. She certainly didn't get the part where he told me he wanted me to be my friend. He said that was all he could offer me and I'd accepted it. Being his friend was better than
                                            nothing. However, it was going to be a lot of harder than I thought. Anyway, back to the present, it was lunch time; we were sitting on one of the cafeteria's square tables. Yeah, I finally came back to school.
                                            I had a lot to catch up with but Lau was helping me with it, besides annoying the hell out of me of course. "Admit it." She said aiming her fork at me. "I am not a chicken," I uttered each word slowly. "Who's
                                            a chicken?" Jason joined us sitting next to Laura. "Jules," Lau replied quickly. Jason gave me a confused look before focusing on his full tray of food. That guy could eat like a pig. "Why?" he asked giving
                                            his burger a bite. "Well, she is crazy about Evan but she didn't even try kissing him last week." I glared at Laura but she ignored me when she heard the voice of her current boyfriend. "Hey, guys, what's up?"
                                            Jordan greeted us. Jason nodded and I simply smiled at him. Jordan kissed Lau shortly "Hey, hottie." Lau giggled. I rolled my eyes. "Hey, handsome." She replied batting her eyelashes at him. "I'm going to steal
                                            this beauty from you for a sec," Jordan informed us holding her hand. Jason and I simply nodded. The lovely couple left to do God knows what and I was kind of glad they did because Lau could be really annoying
                                            when she got something in mind. She was determined to get me to tell Evan my feelings. Yeah, like I would be brave enough to do that. Now, there was just me and Jason. It was then I remembered Jason knew Evan.
                                            I snapped my head towards him. Jason's mouth was full; he stared at me confused like a deer caught in the headlights. "What?" he managed to ask through his full mouth. "First of all, swallow that." I ordered
                                            disgusted "And second, how come you didn't tell me you knew Evan?" I waited for him to swallow his food and take a sip of his coca-cola. "I didn't know it was the same Evan." Jason shrugged "Small world, huh?"
                                            I punched his shoulder. "Helen is his sister." I whispered. "So?" "You're using my ultimate crush' sister as a sex toy?" I inquired demandingly. "In my defense, I met her first." "What?" I scowled at him. "Helen
                                            and I were already screwing before you met Evan." He explained. "Can you just not say that word, please?" I pleaded holding the brick of my nose between my index and my thumb. "What? Screwing?" "Oh God!" "Oh
                                            come on, you're seventeen. You can say bad words, you know." "Jason, focus!" I poked his forehead. "Stop hitting me!" "Then stop changing the subject" I shot back annoyed. Jason sighed. "What do you want me
                                            to do?" "She and Evan have been through enough. I just hope she doesn't get hurt because of you." "What would she? Listen," Jason started seriously "We both know what we're doing. It's not like I lied to her
                                            to get her on my bed. She knows how this works." "I'm sorry but I don't believe in that 'Friends with benefits' thing. I mean, haven't you watched the movie? Haven't you read the statistics? One of you is going
                                            to get attached and most of times; it's the girl who gets attached." "Since when do you read statistics?" "Since I got sick and spent a week doing nothing in my house but that's not the point." I lied shamelessly.
                                            Truth was, I actually did some research about the Friend with benefits thing since that day we watched the movie. I had the hope that could work with Evan. Yeah, I know that's lame but hey it was not easy to
                                            control this urge I had to kiss him. "Jules, I..." Jason trailed off running his fingers through his hair "She's cool with this. I know she is." "Really?" I narrowed my eyes at him. Jason looked away nervously
                                            "What are you hiding from me?" "Nothing." He scratched his ear. "You're omitting something." "I'm not." "Yes, you just scratched your ear. You do that when you lie." I accused him. "Arg!" Jason growled "Sometimes,
                                            I hate you for knowing me so much." "So? What is it?" he hesitated for a moment "Come on, spit it out." "Well, it's probably nothing..." "Spit it out, Jason." "The other day we were doing it in my car and-"
                                            "Oh my God! Seriously? Your car? I'm so not getting in that car again." Jason gave me a killer look "Sorry, sorry, continue." "I was on top, it felt so good-" "Ok, you can skip the details." I scrunched my nose
                                            in disgust. "The thing is, I looked down at her and we locked gazes for a moment. I felt something, I'm not sure. There was something in her eyes that caught me and somehow that made everything more intense."
                                            I couldn't help grinning at him. "You're sooooo falling for her." I teased excited. "What? No! I'm not looking for anything serious right now and you know it." "Alright, just answer me this," I couldn't remove
                                            the big grin from my face as I spoke "are you seeing someone else?" "No," "So you're exclusive?" "I guess so." "Is she seeing someone else?" I asked watching his reaction. He pressed his lips together as his
                                            jaw clenched. Oh boy, he was so into that girl. "I don't know," he replied shrugging his shoulders "I don't care." "Liar." I chuckled. I was happy to know he cared for her. I mean, Jason was a good boy. Even
                                            though, he had his player's moments a few times, he didn't lie to the girls. He let them know how things were going to be from the beginning. I think that was pretty fair, the girls knew what they were getting
                                            themselves into. He didn't act like he wanted something serious to get them on his bed. That was Shane's modus operandi. I was sure he'd lied to Melissa; heck he even lied to me to get me to help him with her.
                                            He broke hearts easily without looking back. Thinking of the devil... Shane Mason, better known as the Antichips or Jerkpid, made his way through the cafeteria. He walked like he owned the place and everyone
                                            in it. He was wearing blue jeans and a dark sweater with a blue t-shirt underneath, it made his skin look paler than usual. Every girl in the room-including me- was staring at him. Most of the girls gazed at
                                            him dreamily whilst others were glaring at him. He probably broke their hearts. I prayed to God for him not to see me. He stopped in front of a table filled with guys. I looked back at my food and started eating.
                                            Thank you, God. "Jones," Shane's voice sounded right behind me. I celebrated too soon. I felt his hands on my shoulder; he squeezed them gently "You came back." "No, I'm a hologram." I replied sarcastically.
                                            Jason snickered. Shane let go of my shoulders and sat next to me. "Sarcasm doesn't suit you, Jones." I looked at him and instantly regretted it. We were way too close for my liking. Besides, Shane was looking
                                            hot today. I swallowed hard and he smirked knowingly. He could be a heartless jerk but he sure knew how hot he was "Close your mouth, babe. No need to drool in public," I glared at him and straightened in my
                                            seat to look at Jason, but I only found an empty seat. "Where's Jason?" I asked frowning. "He left when you started drooling over me," "I wasn't-Ah, never mind." I took a sip of my strawberry's juice. It was
                                            then I remembered Shane knew about wattpad and Evan "How do you know about wattpad?" I glanced at him from the corner of my eye, Shane tensed up. "What are you talking about?" "Last week, when you asked me about
                                            Evan ... you said 'That's the guy from wattpad, isn't he?'" I fully looked at him this time. Shane shifted on his seat. "Hum, I said that?" I nodded "Well, let's just say Laura is not good keeping secrets when
                                            she's with Jordan." My jaw almost dropped to the floor. "She told you?" I asked shocked. "Yeah," Shane mumbled and got off the chair "I gotta go now. See you around." Ok, that was just weird. I was left alone
                                            just like that. I'd always thought it was kind of depressing to eat alone, it seemed like my friends didn't think the same way. Way to go, guys! ** After eating -more like devouring- my food, I stared at my
                                            glass of Strawberry's juice. Mrs. Strawberry... Evan... The only thought of him made my stomach flutter. I couldn't stop thinking about him. Everything reminded me of him, even the glass of strawberry juice
                                            I had in front of me. How could something so simple remind me of him? My phone buzzed in my pocket snapping me out of my thoughts. I quickly checked it. It was a text from Evan. Yeah, I finally got his number.
                                            I touched my phone's screen to open the text. From: Evan &lt;3 Guess what? Me: What? Him: I'm eating Ruffles ;) Me: -.-! So you decided to rub it on my face? Him: Of course. Me: That's so sweet of you (Sarcasm!)
                                            Him: I don't know why you like them so much though. They're not that good. Oh, he did not just say that! I glared at my phone's screen. Me: You don't wanna go there. Him: You don't scare me, little peach. Me:
                                            Again with the nicknames? Him: Yeah ;) Me: I'm gonna find a nickname for you and it won't be nice. Him: Right, I'm so scared. I narrowed my eyes at the screen, I was about to reply when the bell rang. I told
                                            him I would text him later before running out of the cafeteria. I couldn't be late to my next class. ** By the end of the day, I was dragging myself out of school. I wasn't sick anymore but I was still kind
                                            of weak. Mom said that was normal, that sensation would last for a few days. I hated being sick. At least, my mother was a doctor and I didn't have to go to the hospital. I hated hospitals, they gave me the
                                            chills since the day I watched a marathon of horror Japanese movies. They all took place in some gloomy, creepy hospital. I shivered remembering them. Yawning, I started to cross the football field to get to
                                            the parking lot. I really hoped Laura hadn't forgotten about me. She was my ride today. I felt a few eyes on me, the football team was practicing. I tried to ignore the stares. I knew I wasn't really good-looking,
                                            especially today. I was wearing worn pants and a loose purple t-shirt that said 'Bite me' on the front. My hair was in a lazy bun and I didn't put any make-up whatsoever that morning. Conclusion: I probably
                                            looked terrible. My phone buzzed in my hand and I opened the text quickly. From: Evan &lt;3 Nice t-shirt ;) I frowned and stopped on my tracks. I lifted my gaze to scan my surroundings. My heart started hammering
                                            inside my chest. He couldn't have seen me, could he? As in reply, my eyes caught some movement on the way ahead of me. There he stood... Evan... He was leaning against a black car. My breath was caught inside
                                            my lungs. My stomach did a black flip. I wasn't expecting to see him so soon. I wasn't mentally prepared to see him. God, he looked so hot. He was wearing dark pants, a grey hoodie with a dark t-shirt underneath.
                                            His midnight-black hair was messy in a sexy way. His full lips formed a sexy smirk. We were still a few meters away. I found the strength to start walking again. My hands were getting sweaty as I approached
                                            to him. I swallowed feeling my dry throat. How could he make feel so much by just standing in front of me? "Hey, what are you do-doing here?" I stuttered nervously. He shoved his hands inside his hoodie's pockets.
                                            "I'm waiting for Helen," he replied casually. "Oh," I looked down at the pavement playing with my fingers. Breathe! "Jules?" his sexy voice sent a shiver through my spine. I looked up to meet his penetrating
                                            deep dark eyes. They seemed to pull me towards him. "Yeah?" "Are you okay? You look a little pale," his eyes were scrutinizing me. I just want to kiss you like there's no tomorrow, that's all. "I'm fine." I
                                            said instead. Evan narrowed his eyes slightly. "You sure?" I simply nodded. "So," I started clapping my hands trying to act casual "I've never seen you before here," "I don't come here very often. I only come
                                            when Helen doesn't have a ride." He explained "I guess I'm her last option." I chuckled. "That's nice of you to come all the way here to give her a ride home." I stated honestly. "You think I'm nice now?" he
                                            cocked an eyebrow playfully. "Maybe," "Maybe?" he asked taking a step towards me. "Yeah," I teased grinning at him. He smiled, his cute dimples forming on his cheeks. He looked so cute when he smiled. "What
                                            about you? Do you have a ride home?" "Hum," I held my chin as if I was deep in thought when I was actually scanning the parking lot "Laura is my ride but I don't see her around." "She left a few minutes ago,"
                                            Evan said coolly. "What? Really? You saw her?" Evan nodded. I growled in frustration, how could she forget about me? "I can give you a ride home," Evan offered "I mean, if you want to." "Are you sure?" I asked
                                            not knowing if Helen would be cool with this. "Of course." A cool breeze brushed past us, making a lock of my hair to get loose from the bun. Evan extended his hand towards me and tuck the rebel hair behind
                                            my ear. I stopped breathing when his fingertips made contact with my skin. His eyes never left mine. He cupped my cheek and I fought the urge to close my eyes. Then, his thumb caressed my lower lip slowly. I
                                            parted my lips in anticipation. What was he doing? "Evan!" A sharp voice shouted snapping me out of the moment. Evan took a step backwards, retracting his hand "Didn't you get my text?" a very cheerful Helen
                                            asked Evan as she came towards us. "What text?" Evan frowned at her. "I texted you telling you I didn't need a ride. Jason is going to take me home." It was then she noticed me "Hey, you're Jules, right?" "Yep,
                                            that's me." I smiled at her. "It's good to meet you. Jason has told me a lot about you." I sensed a bit of jealousy in her tone but ignored it. "Yeah, he told me a lot about you, too." Including how good it
                                            was last time you two did it in his car. I was so not going to say that. Helen stared at me for a moment, her eyes scanning my body and then going up to my face. Her shoulders relaxed and she smirked. She probably
                                            didn't feel threatened by me anymore. I mean, I looked pretty bad right now. I wouldn't consider myself a threaten. "Well, I have to go. He's waiting for me." She said squeezing Evan's shoulder "Sorry, bro.
                                            I didn't mean to make you come for nothing." "It's cool." Evan replied. Helen glanced at me and gave me a closed mouth smile. "It was nice to meet you, Jules." She said before walking off. I could tell she wasn't
                                            really a fan of me already. And to think, she actually got laid using my condoms. Ungrateful girl! "You ready?" Evan's voice caught my attention. It was then I came back to reality. Evan was going to take home...
                                            Alone... We were going to be alone in his car. Oh boy, I was going to need all my self-control to survive this chaotic ride home. Because hell, my urge to kiss that mysterious sexy boy was growing bigger each
                                            passing second. "Yep, I'm ready." I said smiling at him. Tempting ride, here we go. X M W L X A/N: Hello, awesomers (Yeah, I made up that word cause I'm cool like that) I hope you enjoyed reading this chapter

                                            this chapter :D Thanks to all of you for voting, commenting and being the awesome fans you are &lt;3 My Wattpad Love Chapter 22 Okay, this was a lot of harder than I thought. As soon as I got inside Evan's car
                                            and closed the door, I could feel the tension forming in the air. It was so thick I fought the urge to jump out of the car and ran away like a crazy person. I watched him get in the car as well. He put his seatbelt
                                            on and flashed me a smile. God, stop smiling, you cute boy! It's not helping! Evan started the engine; the car roared to life. "You ready?" He asked, giving me a quick glance. I loved his eyes. They were so
                                            deep. "Yeah," I replied nervously. Evan grinned at me and leaned closer. I stopped breathing as I watched his beautiful face getting closer to mine. His dark gaze dropped to my lips. Was he going to kiss me?
                                            He passed an arm around my waist; by this moment we were so close his breath was fanning my lips. I swallowed. "Jules..." His sexy voice trailed off, sending a shiver through me. "Ye-yes?" I stuttered feeling
                                            lost in the depth of his eyes. "Never forget your seatbelt." I frowned and then I heard a click sound. Evan leaned backwards and straightened in his seat. It took me five seconds to understand what he'd done.
                                            I looked down to see my seatbelt and understood everything. When I looked back up at him, he was smirking victoriously at me. "Now you're ready," he said amused as he started driving off the parking lot. I glared
                                            at his profile. He seemed to enjoy messing with me. I knew he knew I liked him, so what was the point of teasing me like that? That was just mean. "You look cute when you blush," he whispered, his eyes focused
                                            on the road ahead us. "I'm not blushing," I affirmed even when I could feel my flaming cheeks. "Yeah right." I narrowed my eyes at him. I opened my mouth to say something but shut it when my eyes landed on the
                                            tattoo on his neck. I could see it pretty clearly now. I couldn't help feeling curious about it. I'd never been a fan of tattoos but that was a really good one, it looked so professional and well-done. Besides,
                                            it suited Evan and his mysterious attitude. "Where did you get that?" I asked, my eyes glued to the dark lines of his tattooed neck. "What?" He glanced at me from the corner of his eye. "The tattoo." Evan's
                                            smile vanished; he hesitated for a moment. "I got it in a friend's tattoo shop." "Why?" The question left my lips before I could stop it. "I mean, there must be a reason behind it." "Not really," he replied
                                            a little bit too quickly. "I was young and stupid. Besides, I was drunk." "That doesn't look like a drunken tattoo." I stated honestly. "Then what does look like, Jules?" His tone became slightly cold. I was
                                            taken aback by his sudden change of mood. He gripped the steering wheel with ferocity. Alright, maybe I shouldn't have asked anything. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to..." I trailed off unsure of what to say. Evan
                                            let out a long sigh. "It's cool," he stated relaxing his shoulders. I didn't need to be smart to know there was a big reason behind that tattoo. Evan was definitely lying when he said it was just a drunken thing.
                                            Silence reigned in the car, making the already crushing tension between us even thicker. I rubbed my sweaty palms on my jeans awkwardly and stared through the window. "So," Evan broke the silence and I mentally
                                            thanked him for it, "tell me more about your cheesy story." I scowled at him. "Really? I thought you didn't read it," I folded my arms across my chest. "It entertains me," he admitted, rolling his full lower
                                            lip into his mouth. I gawked at him, I wanted to taste those red lips so badly. "Jules?" his voice snapped me out of my inappropriate thoughts. "Huh?" I closed my mouth and looked away. "I asked you a question."
                                            "You did?" I could feel the blood pumping up to my cheeks again. "Sorry, what was it?" I kept my eyes glued to the road. "Does she ever tell him the way she feels?" I furrowed my eyebrows in confusion. "Who?"
                                            "Rose." "Oh, you're talking about my story," I laughed nervously feeling like an idiot. Evan stopped at a red light and turned half of his body towards me. His dark eyes met my blue ones and I backed away a
                                            little in my seat. "So, does she tell him or not?" He sounded pretty curious about it. I swallowed. "It's pretty obvious she's dying to say something." My heart was hammering inside my chest, my throat felt
                                            dry. Why did I feel like he wasn't talking about my story but me? "I can't tell you that. You must read to find out." Wow, that was a clever answer. I high-fived myself. Mentally, of course. "Come on, we're
                                            friends, aren't we?" Unfortunately, we are. "I can't tell you." I tried to keep a strong pose. Evan leaned closer to me. "Is there any way I can persuade you?" he asked hoarsely. I shook my head because I could
                                            no longer utter a word. "Are you sure?" His warm hand cupped my cheek. I closed my eyes for a moment enjoying his touch. He's playing with you! My inner voice snapped me out of my trance. I slapped his hand
                                            away and looked right into his eyes defiantly. "I won't tell you. Period," I said feeling proud of myself. "Why are you so eager to know anyway?" "I'm just curious," he shrugged his shoulders. "I want to know
                                            how long it'll take her to throw herself at him." "She wo-" I covered my mouth. Evan chuckled. "What was that?" "Nothing," I looked away. "She won't what?" "I'm not going to tell you a thing, mister." I could
                                            feel his eyes on me. It was making me uneasy. "And stop staring at me," "Then tell me." "Nope." "I won't move then," he stated obstinately. I watched how the red light became green; immediately we heard the
                                            horns behind us. I looked at the stubborn driver. He was still gazing at my direction fully. "You need to move." "No." "Evan..." "Jules..."he teased, grinning like a cat. "Move," I ordered, emphasizing the 'O'.
                                            "Tell me or we'll get beaten up by a bunch of angry drivers. It's up to you," he said as careless as the wind. "Are you blackmailing me?" I held my chest dramatically. "Maybe, is it working?" I glared at him.
                                            The street had quickly become noisy, filled with all the honking cars behind us. I looked at the rear-view mirror and watched a huge man coming out of his car, heading towards us. Oh no... "Fine! Move!" I exclaimed
                                            panicking. "You mean you're going to tell me?" "Yes! Move! Now!" The big man was coming closer. "Promise it," "I promise!" I shouted scared. Evan drove off leaving the Hulk behind. Jesus Christ, that was close.
                                            "I'm waiting," Evan chanted softly. I gave him a killer look. "You do realize we were this close," I made a gesture with my index and thumb, "to being brutally murdered by Hulk." Evan laughed loudly. God, even
                                            his laugh was sexy. What am I thinking? I should be mad at him! "You are so dramatic," he spoke, shaking his head. "Am not!" "Sure, Mrs. Strawberry." My heart skipped a beat. It felt so weird to hear him call
                                            me that. It created sort of an intimate connection between us. "I'm waiting," he reminded me. "I refuse to say anything." "You promised you would tell me, Jules." I fought the shiver going up my spine when he
                                            said my name. "No." "You're going to break your promise? There are more semaphores on the way; you wouldn't want us to stop again, would you?" "You are evil." I accused him. We stayed in silence for a few minutes.
                                            I knew he was waiting for me to tell him about my story. Sighing in defeat, I looked through the window as I spoke. "She'll tell him eventually," I said watching the trees rush by. It was then I realized how
                                            much alike the main character of my story and I were. "It's not easy for her. She doesn't want to lose him." I felt like I was talking about me and not a fictional character. Evan pulled over in front of my
                                            house. I felt his eyes on me so I looked at him. His eyes were glowing with something I couldn't decipher. "She shouldn't tell him anything," he commented. My heart sank in my chest. Was it me or were we not
                                            talking about my story anymore? "Why?" I inquired. Evan's lips twitched up, forming his sexy smirk. "She should just man up and kiss him." My eyes widened at his words. I couldn't help blushing; I bit my lower
                                            whilst my eyes were switching from his eyes to his lips. I don't know for how long we remained in the same position. Kiss him! Stop being a chicken! My inner voice was yelling at me but I couldn't seem to find
                                            the strength to do anything. I was actually kind of frozen in my seat. My mind was processing his words, not knowing for sure if he was telling me to kiss him in a very discrete, indirect way. Evan chuckled
                                            and got out of the car. Then he opened my door and offered his hand to me snapping my out of my frozen state. "This is your stop, cheesy writer," he said jokingly. I took his hand, ignoring the tingles that
                                            ran up my arm. "Thank you, dark poet." I stepped out of the car, a cold breeze brushed past me making me shiver. The sky was kind of orange; sunset was here. Evan walked me to the porch in silence. Once we reached
                                            the door, we turned to face each other. I felt kind of small in front of him; he was at least a head taller than me. "Thanks for the ride home," I smiled up at him. Evan shoved his hands inside his hoodie's
                                            pockets. "No problem." I wanted to say so many things, I wanted to tell him how much I liked him, how much I wanted him to kiss me right now but I stood there staring at his handsome face instead. Sadness took
                                            over me when I realized this was all I could get from him. It hurt me to know this friendship would never turn into something else. Being his friend would never be enough for me, I was only prolonging my torture.
                                            I would never see him as a friend. Tears formed in my eyes when I realized when I had to do. I had to let him go... It would be painful but I knew the heartbreak wouldn't last forever. Having him as a friend,
                                            so close yet so far would definitely cause more pain and frustration than letting him go for good. "Jules?" His sexy voice brought me back to reality. "Yeah?" I swallowed a lump in my throat. "Is there something
                                            wrong?" he asked, concern plastered on his face. Yeah, I'm crazy about you so that's why I'm going to do this. "Yep, I'm good. See you around." I got inside the house quickly, and closed the door behind me.
                                            I wasn't brave enough to tell him a thing on his face. So, I took my phone out of my pocket and typed a quick text whilst hearing his car's engine. I walked to the living room and dropped myself on one of the
                                            couches as I pressed the send option: Sorry, thought I could do this but I can't be your friend. Sending that message was like stabbing myself. My heart was shrinking in my chest. No more funny nicknames or
                                            poems, no more waking up to his nice messages, no more dragons fluttering in my stomach each time I talked to him. No more Evan... His cute smile displayed inside my head as the memory of his sexy voice filled
                                            my ears. My phone buzzed in my hands. Evan's reply came a lot of faster than I expected. Evan: What are you talking about? :/ Me: I can't be your friend, I'm sorry. I'll be out of your life for good. Evan: You're
                                            joking, right? Me: No. A tear rolled down my cheek. I needed to be strong now that I finally had the courage to let him go. Evan: What did I do wrong? Me: Nothing, I just can't be your friend. Please, stop texting
                                            me. I begged, knowing it would be harder to do this if he kept talking to me. He didn't reply causing more tears to fill my eyes. He was going to respect my decision, wasn't he? I got on my feet and paced around
                                            my living room trying to ease my aching heart. I ran my fingers through my hair with my shaking hand. The front door was swung open and I snapped my head towards it. There he stood... Evan... He was holding
                                            his phone in one hand and the doorknob in the other. "What are you doing here?" I asked wiping my tears away. Seeing him again was like adding fuel to the fire in my chest. Evan walked towards me with long strides.
                                            "I want you to say it to my face," his black eyes were darker than usual. "Tell me you don't want to see me anymore." I looked away from his intense gaze. "Please, don't make this any harder for me." "What are
                                            you talking about, Jules? Look at me." He held my chin forcing to meet his gaze "Why can't we be friends?" "Just..." I trailed off sadly "Just go," I backed away from him. Evan grabbed my arm pulling me towards
                                            him. "I won't go until you tell me the reason why we can't be friends." He sounded upset. "Let me go!" I struggled to release myself, his touch made me feel so warm inside. "Tell me." "No." "Tell me." He leaned
                                            closer to me. I had nothing left to lose, did I? His face was mere inches from mine. "I shouldn't tell you anything," I whispered, remembering his words, Evan's heavy breath was brushing my mouth teasingly.
                                            "I should just man up and kiss you." I got on my tiptoes, and pressed my lips against his. A shot of electricity crossed my body. His lips were so soft. I leaned back to see his reaction; I ached for more of
                                            his lips but I needed to know if he wanted it to. Evan seemed surprised but then he grabbed a fist of my hair and kissed me passionately. I'd never been kissed like this before, there was so much need and passion
                                            in the way he moved his mouth on mine that I felt weak in the knees. It was like he couldn't get enough of me. The kiss was becoming more and more urgent; I could feel my blood running hot through my veins.
                                            He wrapped his free arm around my waist pulling me closer, our bodies pressing together. He slid his tongue inside my mouth and I could feel my entire body getting hot. I wanted more, so much more. He sucked
                                            on my lower lip, gaining a soft moan from me. Evan broke the kiss and took a step backwards. We were both breathing heavily. Our lips were red and swollen. That was the best kiss I'd ever had. "I...this is..."
                                            Evan was lost for words. "I have to go." He turned on his feet and walked away. I was left there in pure shock. My entire body was throbbing, my lips were tingling. I wanted more... so much more of Evan. X M

                                            23 ******************************************* Dedicated to Zach for editing this chapter. You did a great job, you truly rock haha :) Thanks for the support, guys! My Wattpad Love Chapter 23 I didn't move.
                                            I didn't breathe. I didn't do anything - not even when the house phone started ringing, not even when my phone buzzed in my hand. Evan kissed me... Well technically, I'd kissed him first, but then he kissed
                                            me, and for the raw passion he showed throughout the kiss he definitely enjoyed it. I stared at my opened front door in silence. I could see my front garden; the vanishing sunlight was brushing the dead flowers
                                            softly. I smiled like fool, a wave of happiness and relief washing over me. Happiness because I'd just had the best kiss of my entire life and relief because Evan didn't reject me, which was my worst fear. I
                                            brought a hand to my mouth and I swear I could still feel his soft lips against mine. I never thought a kiss could me make feel so many things. I had been kissed before but never felt this way about it. Actually,
                                            my past attempts of dates never really went for the whole French kiss thing. Evan, on the other hand... well, the guy was an expert on the French kiss area; if he hadn't broken the kiss I could have easily spent
                                            the rest of my life with my face glued to his. However, I doubted that could happen since Evan was nowhere to be seen. Realization came down on me like a bucket filled with ice-cubes. Evan left. He'd gone. He
                                            walked away. I'd never been so confused about my emotions. I was happy a second ago but suddenly now sadness was taking over me even though a part of me was still squealing excitedly about the kiss. Such a bittersweet
                                            moment... The wind slammed my door closed in a very violent move making me jump awake. I'd been in some sort of trance. The house phone was ringing. I snapped my head towards it. What if it was Evan? Was he
                                            calling me to apologize for leaving like that? That didn't sound like something he would do, but I still hoped that was what he was going to do. Grasping some courage, I answered the phone. "Ugh, hello?" I had
                                            a hard time finding my voice. "Jules!" My mother's voice exclaimed into my ear. Relief and disappointment filled me. God, I really needed to stop these contradictory emotions in me. "Hi, Mom." "Where were you?
                                            I've been calling for a while now." Her tone was demanding. Feeling like a thief caught in the act, I swallowed a lump in throat. "I was..." Making out with my ultimate crush in our living room. Yeah, like I
                                            would say that. I needed to come up with a lie, which knowing me wouldn't turn out any good. "I was..." I trailed off again. Don't say anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid! "I was... Eating?" I finished
                                            uncertainly. Phew! That wasn't so bad. "Eating?" Mom repeated incredulously. "Eating what?" "Nuts," I said stupidly. And you ruined it, idiot! "You don't like nuts," my mother reminded me "What's going on, Julie?
                                            Is everything alright?" "Everything is absolutely, definitely, perfectly fine," I replied in a rush. Oh verbal diarrhea! Thank you, brain. "Did you just use three adverbs in one sentence?" Mom seemed to be getting
                                            more and more suspicious. "Yeah, I... It's an exercise... My English homework actually. You know adverbs, verbs, adjectives, kiss." I quickly snapped my mouth shut. "Kiss? Julia Ann Jones, what the hell is going
                                            on?" "He, I... There was a kiss in a book we're reading in class so yeah," I explained, laughing nervously. I suck at lying! My God! "I'm going home," Mom informed, sounding angry. "No, Mom, I swear everything
                                            is fine!" "Sweetie, I'm your mother. I know you, not to mention you are a terrible liar. You got that from your father." There was a silence. It was the first time that Mom had mentioned him in a while. She
                                            seemed to realize that too because she didn't say anything else. "You don't need to come home. You have patients to take care of, and I'm fine, Mom. Trust me." "Just promise me you'll explain everything to me
                                            tomorrow, alright?" She didn't sound angry anymore. She sounded worried. "I promise," I stated in a defeated tone. There was no point in continuing this futile attempt to lie. "Alright, I'll check on you every
                                            two hours. Lock the doors and-" "All the windows," I finished for her. I was used to being alone in my house. Mom's job forced me to get used to it. Somehow, that made me more independent and mature in some
                                            aspects. Mom hung up after making some comments about behaving and being a responsible daughter. I couldn't blame her, she knew I'd been lying and she still let it pass... until tomorrow, that is. I shuddered
                                            thinking of her interrogatory. I let myself fall on the armrest of the couch and blew a strand of hair out of my face. What a long day! I looked down at my phone where a few mails from Wattpad were waiting,
                                            but none of them said anything about dark_poet001. Should I text him? But what was I going to say? 'Hey, I was wondering why you ran away after we shared that awesome mind-blowing kiss.' Nah, that was not happening.
                                            I'd run out of bravery for the day. I needed to talk to someone. Needing a friend, I scrolled down my mobile messenger contacts. I knew I would find Laura online. Me: Where are u? LauIsASexybeast: Jordan's place.
                                            Why? Me: I need to talk to you. Can you come over? LauIsASexybeast: Something wrong? Me: No, but I need someone to talk with. It's cool if you can't come though. LauIsASexyBeast: I'm coming. Don't do anything
                                            stupid. Me: Anything stupid? LauIsASexyBeast: Yeah, like killing yourself or throwing away your awesome purple top. Me: You're crazy. LauIsASexyBeast: Haha I'll be there soon. Me: Ok. I threw my phone on the
                                            couch and got to my feet. I needed a glass of water. The turmoil of emotions inside me had been overwhelming. I was heading towards the kitchen when- "Mi corazon esta abierto, lo tengo que cerrar, me importas
                                            tanto. Eres mi debilidad." I stopped on my tracks frowning at the song echoing behind me "Mis heridas me recuerdan, que el pasado es real." What the hell? Was that my phone? Was that a song... in Spanish? Why
                                            on Earth... Ask questions later! Answer the phone! Slowly, I went to pick up my phone. I scowled at the ID: Jason rocks :D "What the hell, Jason?" I answered, totally confused. "Your ringtone-" "Is a song in
                                            Spanish," he interrupted me and chuckled. "That's a pretty good song." Okay, so everyone seemed to feel right with changing their ringtone in my phone without my permission. Great! "When did you-" "Jules, listen."
                                            Jason cut me off. "What did you say to Helen?" "What are you talking about?" I frowned. "Well, she didn't give me my dose of sex today." I rolled my eyes at his remark. "And what does that have to do with me?"
                                            "Because after getting off my car, she said, and I quote, 'Go ask Jules for it. I'll bet she'll be more than happy to please you.' My jaw dropped to the floor. "What?" "Great, now you're deaf. I won't repeat
                                            the whole thing." "No, I heard you. I just... What would she... I didn't say anything. I met her at the parking lot but we barely talked." "You sure? She seems pretty sure you and I have a passionate hidden
                                            best friends' affair." "Best friends' affair, seriously, Jason?" I wanted to slap him through the phone. He chuckled. "Can't deny I'm creative, huh?" "You're an idiot." "You still love me so that makes you idioter
                                            than me." "Idioter? That's not even a word!" "But it sounds cool, doesn't it?" I face-palmed myself. Maybe the wild sex was killing my best friend's brain cells in a slow but steady process "Your Mom is on duty,
                                            right?" He asked, dragging me back to reality. "Yeah," "I'm coming over so we can talk better about this," "Alright, see you soon." I hung up, feeling confused. Why would Helen say that? Was she jealous? That
                                            was a good sign; it meant she cared for Jason. After eating two bags of Ruffles, drinking coca-cola and locking all my windows, I finally heard a car's engine outside the house. Finally! It took them long enough.
                                            "Jules?" I heard Lau's voice and then some knocking on my door. "Coming!" I shouted, throwing the empty Ruffles' bags in the trash can. I opened the door to see a grinning Laura. God, Jordan was definitely making
                                            this girl happy. "Hey, twin." She kissed my cheek and walked inside. We sat down on the big couch in Indian style facing each other. "I have something to tell you, too," Lau stated with a flustered face. "But
                                            you go first." I let out a sigh before telling her the entire story, from the tempting ride to the passionate kiss. "Oh my God!" Lau squealed excitedly. "You kissed him! I can't believe it! No offense, but I
                                            never thought you'd get the courage to do it!" Lau clapped her hands. "How was it? Did you like it? How long did it last? Did he use his tongue?" "Whoa! Slow down, woman!" "Oh come on! Tell me! I want every
                                            juicy detail!" "It was amazing." I looked at nothing in particular as I spoke. "It was the best kiss I've ever had-not that I've had many- but yeah." I closed my eyes remembering the kiss; a smile crept to my
                                            lips. "There was so much passion..." I opened my eyes slowly, but my smile vanished when I remembered he'd left. "But then he left," I added sadly. "Maybe he was shocked or something," Lau said, holding her
                                            chin as if she was deep in thought. "You probably caught him off guard. I mean, everyone knows you're a chicken." I glared at her. "Don't look at me like that. It's true. So, your sudden act of bravery must've
                                            have shocked him." "You think so?" "It's just a possibility. Men are kind of hard to read," Lau confirmed. "You think we should ask Jason about it?" "Sure, it'll be good to see this from a man's point of view."
                                            Lau shrugged her shoulders. We chatted some more about the kiss. Let me tell you something, Lau was a sucker for details. "So, what did you want to talk about?" I asked. Lau blushed and looked down. "Lau?" "Well,
                                            I..." "You...?" I stared at her. "Jordan and I were making out on his couch and he..." she paused, "Well, wekindofgottosecondbase." She rushed her words making it almost impossible for me to understand her.
                                            Key word here: almost. She was my best friend; I was more than used to understanding her rushed sentences. "You did what?!" I jumped on the couch bewildered. "Wait... Second base is..." I gestured towards the
                                            boob's area. Lau nodded. Oh God! I was the one asking for every single detail now. Seemed like Lau was not the only sucker for details today. We spent the night talking about everything. We prepared some hot
                                            chocolate and decide to watch some thriller film. We were half-way the movie when my phone buzzed in my pants. I checked it desperately but it was only a text from Jason. Jason rocks :D Sorry! Can't come over!
                                            Helen changed her mind :D I rolled my eyes and typed a reply: Good for you. Have fun. "Who is it?" Lau asked as she sipped on her chocolate. "Is it him?" I knew she referred to Evan. I shook my head sadly. "Nope,
                                            it's Jason. He's not coming. Apparently, Helen is not angry anymore," I replied. "Seems like Jay-Jay is getting laid tonight," Lau snickered. "He hates than nickname, you know," I commented. "That's the point."
                                            Lau grinned at me. Lau and Jason got along in a very weird way. Some days they couldn't stand each other and then there were these days when they acted like good friends. I guess they just had those types of
                                            personalities that collide once in a while. I stared at my phone intently. I was dying to text Evan. Lau had distracted me a lot but he was still present in my mind most of the time. "Why don't you text him?"
                                            Lau seemed to be reading my mind, not literally of course, that'd be pretty weird. "I don't know. What am I going to say?" "Anything, just talk to him," she encouraged. "He left. He should be the one texting
                                            me, he owes me an explanation." "You know how he acts. Do you honestly believe he's going to text you?" "No," I sighed. "Then you go ahead, don't waste your time waiting for something that will never happen."
                                            Listening to my best friend, I started typing a text. After hesitating, deleting words, writing again, deleting and finally writing a final text I sent it: Hi. Yeah, don't judge me. I just needed to know if
                                            he was going to talk to me before texting anything more serious. When my phone notified there was a new text from Evan. I hesitated to read it. My poor heart was beating so fast I thought it would come out of
                                            my throat. I touched the screen to open the text: From: Evan &lt;3 Hey. Really? Hey? That was all he could say? You texted him 'Hi' what were you expecting? My inner voice snapped at me. I looked up to check
                                            on Lau. She seemed to be swallowed by the movie because her eyes were focused on the TV - and she wasn't even blinking. I bit my lower lip as I typed a reply to Evan: We need to talk. I waited for his reply
                                            but it never came so I texted him again, Are you there? No reply, it was obvious he was avoiding the talk. Sighing in frustration, I looked at the TV trying to catch up with the movie, checking my phone each
                                            two minutes. Evan never replied. Lau and I watched some other films and then we talked about everything. It'd been a while since we'd a moment for ourselves, so time flew by as we spoke. Lau was telling something
                                            about her dancing class when my eyes landed on the window next to my front door. My eyes widened in shock. "Oh My god!" I exclaimed, jumping out of the couch. I stared at the sunlight streaming through the window.
                                            "What?" Lau stood up and frowned at me. "It's the sun!" I exclaimed freaking out. Lau's frown turned bigger. "Yeah, what's wrong with it? Are we role playing the vampire movie we watched a few hours ago?" She
                                            asked amusedly. I glared at her. "Very funny but no," I said, picking up the empty bags of Ruffles, Doritos, chocolate bars, coca-cola cans and so on. "Mom's duty ends at 6:00 am so that means she's-" I was
                                            interrupted by the sound of an engine outside the house. "Oh shit! She's here!" I threw everything in the trash can and held Lau's hand to pull her upstairs "Run!" I hissed. When we were lying on my bed hidden
                                            under the sheets, Lau took the opportunity to make questions. "What's going on?" She whispered secretively. "If Mom finds out we stayed up all night, she'll kill us, but not before giving us the entire sleeping
                                            habits speech." Lau made an O with her mouth in realization. "Did you turn off the TV?" She asked worriedly. I panicked. "No!" "Then-" I covered her mouth when I heard footsteps in the hallway. "Shhh! Pretend
                                            to be asleep!" I ordered but as soon as I closed my eyes I didn't need to pretend anything because I quickly fell in dreamland. ** Poke Poke Poke I was dragged out of sleep by an incessant poking on my forehead.
                                            As my senses were waking up, I started hearing voices around me. "Leave her alone!" Lau's voice sounded irritated. "No, she's been sleeping all day." Was that Shane? "Stop poking her!" The poking stopped. "We're
                                            going to be late because of her!" "She needs to rest," Lau stated. I opened my eyes slowly. The first thing I saw were a pair of beautiful hazel eyes staring at me - Shane's eyes. He was too close for my liking
                                            so I pushed him away. "Sleeping beauty is back," Shane joked, grinning at me. "How was the hibernation?" I ignored him and sat up. "What are you doing here?" I mumbled with a sleepy voice. "We were waiting for
                                            you to wake up. It's been a few hours." Shane folded his arms across his chest. I was about to ask him why when my eyes landed on my window. There was a big full moon on the sky. "Oh God! The moon!" I cried
                                            in shock. "Yeah, you're going to turn into a werewolf now?" Shane joked. Lau punched his shoulder. "Get out," she said, pushing him towards the door. "Oh God! I did sleep all day! It's night already?" I asked
                                            Lau when Shane left us alone. "Yeah, you better hurry." "Why? And what is Shane doing here?" "He came with Jordan. We're going to Helen's birthday party," "Woah woah, what? I'm not going!" Lau grinned at me.
                                            "Evan's probably going to be there," she urged, wiggling her eyebrows. "We are so going!" I said, running towards the bathroom. *** As soon as we parked in front of Helen's house, I grew nervous and insecure.
                                            This didn't seem like a good idea anymore. I mean, Helen didn't really like me so showing up at her birthday party wasn't the brightest idea. Oh Evan... The things I do for you... I thought sadly. I got off
                                            the car and followed Laura. For the first time in a while, I could say I looked good. I was wearing a blue dress that matched my eyes. Laura had straightened my hair making it curly at the ends. She also did
                                            my make-up. That girl could do miracles. Shane and Jordan joined us at the front door. After getting inside the house, I was growing more and more nervous. There were people everywhere. The music was really
                                            loud. How was I supposed to find Evan in this mess? It was like looking for my missing pencil in my room, a total lost cause, I never found it by the way. Jordan and Lau informed me that they were going to look
                                            for some drinks, so I was left alone with Jerkpid. I turned around to ask him something but found an empty space. Of course he would leave me alone here. Smooth, Shane, real smooth. I scanned the crowd warily.
                                            Some people were dancing, others were drinking but most of them were doing both things. Reaching the living room, I rested my side against the wall. I was starting to regret coming here. However, that feeling
                                            went away as soon as my eyes landed on him... Evan... My stomach did a major back flip. He was sitting on the armrest of the couch, dressed in all black as usual. I was frozen in my spot. He seemed to be talking
                                            to someone. I looked at the person standing in front of him and my mouth hung opened. Melissa... Melissa was talking to him, smiling and punching his shoulder playfully. They seemed to be very comfortable around
                                            each other. Were they friends? Evan was smiling at her and I felt a shot of jealousy crossing me. So this is what he was doing while I was dying in my house waiting for his reply to my text. He looked careless.
                                            There was no sign of apprehension on his face. I crossed my fingers for Melissa to go away. It seemed to work because she whispered something in his ear and disappeared in the hallway. You can do this. I squeezed
                                            my sweaty hands and tried to ease my pumping heart. I crept over to him. He hadn't seen me since he was looking to the opposite side of the room. I touched his shoulder getting his attention. His deep-black
                                            eyes met my blue ones and I felt like they were piercing through my soul. He looked surprised, and his smile instantly vanished. "Hey," I greeted shyly. "Hey," he greeted in the same tone. I barely caught his
                                            words through the loud music. I leaned closer to him and whispered in his ear, "Can I talk to you for a sec?" I leaned back not before sensing his fragrant cologne. He smelled so good. Evan nodded and stood
                                            up. He led me through the crowd until we crossed some Victorian doors and entered the lonely peaceful garden. He stopped walking, not even looking at me. "What?" He asked coldly, shoving his hands inside his
                                            pockets. I bit my lower lip. "Why are you ignoring my texts?" I asked straightforwardly. "What are you doing here?" He ignored my question. "I came to see you." There was no need to lie. "We need to talk." "No,
                                            we don't," he retorted harshly. "Could you at least look at me?" I demanded, growing upset. Reluctantly, Evan turned to me. "What do you want from me?" he sighed. "I want answers, Evan. You can't expect me to
                                            act as if nothing happened." "Nothing happened." His words hurt. "You regret kissing me, don't you?" I confirmed. I was on the verge of tears. Evan's cold expression broke for a moment and I thought he would
                                            kiss me and make me forget everything. "Yes," he answered, averting his gaze."It was a mistake." I swear I could hear my heart shattering into a millions pieces. "Oh." I took a step backwards. Two thick tears
                                            escaped my eyes. I wiped them away quickly, and Evan's expression softened when we locked eyes. "Don't cry," he whispered, trying to reach me. I took another step backwards. "Don't touch me!" I yelled at him
                                            angrily. He seemed surprised by my outburst. "You are a jerk! You played with my feelings so carelessly!" My voice broke. "Jules, I-" "Don't! I've tried over and over again to get you to open up to me. I tried
                                            to help you even when all you've done is to push me away. I..." "Jules, It's-" "I've been so stupid," I stammered. Tears rolled down my cheeks freely. "I've been such idiot for thinking you actually cared for
                                            me." I wiped my tears away angrily. "Why would you? I'm just some girl you met on the internet." My sight was blurred with surfacing tears. Evan tried to reach for me again but I slapped his hand. "I never meant
                                            to hurt you," he assured. "But you did," I said sadly. "Don't worry. I'll be okay. I will please you, Evan. I will leave you alone. I'm so done here." I turned on my feet and started running away. "Jules! Wait!"
                                            I heard him scream from behind me, but I ignored him. Tears flew from my face with the wind as I ran out of that house. I've been so stupid. God, this hurt so much. I ran down the sidewalk until I couldn't breathe
                                            and had to stop. I was sobbing uncontrollably, and I was sure my mascara and eyeliner were rolling down with my tears, turning them into a darker shade, but I didn't care. My chest felt so empty; it was the
                                            most painful sensation I'd ever felt in my entire life. Heartbreak... So this was what it felt like to be heartbroken. Let me tell you, it's really devastating. When I thought things couldn't get any worse,
                                            it started to drizzle. Oh Great! Now I was going to freeze to death. The drizzle turned into heavy rain getting me damp in a matter of seconds. I reached the town's square and sat down on one of the banks. What
                                            was wrong with me? How did I end up feeling this strong towards a person I met on the internet? Is it possible to fall for someone over written words? I was proof that it actually was. I'd just felt this strong
                                            connection between Evan and me since the day we'd started talking. I just felt as if we complemented each other. I rubbed my wet face, shivering slightly. I caught some movement from the corner of my eye and
                                            snapped my head towards that direction. My heart skipped a beat. Evan was standing there a few meters from me completely damp. His wet hair was sticking to his forehead and ears. His chest was moving up and
                                            down as if he was breathing heavily. I got on my feet surprised. What was he doing here? He walked to me slowly, our gazes locked. Rain was dripping from his nose and chin. When he was standing right in front
                                            of me, his hands held my face. "I'm so sorry," he whispered, resting his forehead on mine. I didn't know what to say. I had to tilt my head back to look right into his eyes since he was taller than me. Rain
                                            was falling on us relentlessly but I didn't care. Words were unnecessary, I could see everything in his eyes; they were filled with so much regret and need. I cupped his wet cheek and he closed his eyes pressing
                                            his face against my hand. Then, he leaned closer and pressed his wet lips against mine gently. Volts of electricity ran through my entire body. The sensation was so good that I felt my knees go weak. He started
                                            moving his lips on mine slowly as if he wanted to savor me. I eagerly kissed him back with all I had. Below us, my feet felt like they were slowly liquefying in my shoes. Evan gripped my face tightly as he deepened
                                            the kiss, sliding his tongue inside my mouth. He tasted so good, and it felt so right to kiss him. His long fingers tangled through my hair and the kiss turned into a passionate one in a matter of seconds. It
                                            seemed like we couldn't get enough from each other. Evan's hands left my face and went down my arms until he finally wrapped his arm around my waist pulling me closer to him. Our bodies were pressed together,
                                            so that I could feel the warmth radiate from his skin beneath his clothes. The sweet smell of his cologne caught my nose, and I lost myself in his aromatic scent. Our breaths were becoming heavy as the kiss
                                            became more and more intense. Evan bit my lower lip softly, stealing a soft sigh from me. He definitely knew what he was doing. And there, under the rain, I realized I was kissing Evan like there was no tomorrow.
                                            Hell, I was kissing him like we were going to die right after that kiss. There was no point in denying facts. I was not only crazy about him. But I was falling for him, falling hard. X M W L X Long chapter!

                                            say you wanted more ~ what are you waiting for? ~ I'm not running from you. ~ My Wattpad Love Chapter 24 I was lost in Evan's addicting lips. If I'd know kissing him would be this good, I would've have done
                                            it before. Our breaths were heavy as if we'd just run a marathon. I got on my tiptoes to wrap my long arms around his neck, and I could feel the rapid fall and rise of his chest against mine. Cold rain was dousing
                                            us from head to toe but I actually felt warm in his arms. I wanted to stay like this forever. I didn't want anything to ruin this perfect moment. Unfortunately for me, we were humans and we needed to breathe.
                                            I was feeling light-headed already. Reluctantly, I pulled away from him to take a deep breath in. I didn't open my eyes, but pressed my forehead against his. My heart was pumping blood fast through my veins,
                                            making me feel invigorated. My entire body was throbbing, not to mention the rebel dragons fluttering in my stomach. Evan's ragged breath was fanning my lips. "I can't," he murmured, so low that I'd barely heard
                                            him through the heavy rain. "What?" I opened my eyes slowly. His expression was blank, and there was no trace of the regret and need I'd seen on his face before the kiss. He grabbed my wrists to remove my hands
                                            from his neck and took a step backwards, breaking all contact between us. Instantly, my body felt cold without his touch. I stared at him confused. He ran his fingers through his wet hair and rolled his lower
                                            lip into his mouth before speaking, "I'm sorry." Pure regret flooded from his mouth. "W-What?" I spluttered, confused. I tried to reach him but he stepped backwards. My chest tightened. "Evan?" It was then I
                                            noticed his tensed shoulders and defensive pose. There was something wrong here. "Ah, shit!" he exclaimed, turning around holding his head. "Evan, what's wrong?" I asked bewildered. I thought everything was
                                            more than fine, I thought that kiss was a good sign - that he would finally open up to me. Apparently, I thought wrong. Evan turned to me once again, determination plastered on his face. "I can't do this," he
                                            said coldly. "And I won't." I felt pain at the tip of my stomach. "What are you talking about?" I was afraid of the answer to that question. Evan averted his gaze. "I don't want to see you again," he said harshly.
                                            Was I hearing him right? Tears formed in my eyes, blurring my sight. "What? How can you say that after kissing me like that?" I was beyond hurt. "Is this some sort of game for you?" My voice broke and I faltered
                                            near the end. Evan's lips pressed together in a tight line. "I told you I could only offer you my friendship," he retorted. "Friendship?" I mimicked, dazed and shocked. I hoped Evan couldn't see my tears in
                                            the rain. Not someone like him. "You kissed me just a few minutes ago. We both know this is... more than a friendship, Evan. Friends don't kiss each other like that." He didn't say anything. Sadness washed over
                                            me - strong sadness, like a tsunami. This was what it felt like to get your heart broken. It was painful to have an amazing moment with him and then hear him say he didn't want to see me anymore. It was like
                                            falling off a high cloud to crash into a cold hard surface. "Why did you come here? Why did you kiss me?" I demanded, indignation swirling in the pit of my stomach. "I did it on the spur of the moment, I'm sorry
                                            for leading you on like that," he replied. I felt like thousands needles were piercing through my heart, cutting and leaving permanent wounds on it. "See it as a farewell kiss." He tried to smirk but his futile
                                            attempt barely got to a sad smile. My face heated up in anger and I walked to him. I wasn't thinking. I brought my hand to his face and slapped him, hard. The sound of my palm crashing into his cheek echoed
                                            through the rainy square. Evan didn't seem surprise when he turned his face back at me. He rubbed his growing red cheek. "I deserved that," he stated calmly. I'd never been this angry in my life before. I'd
                                            never felt so disappointed, so stupid. "You are such a jerk! How could you play with my feelings like that? How could you-" I broke off, taking a shaky breath. My entire body was shaking in anger. "I didn't
                                            mean for any of this to happen," he tried to explain; his tone was less cold for a moment. My lower lip quivered. Don't cry! I needed strength to yell at him, there was no need to hold back my feelings anymore.
                                            There was no need to be careful about whatever I said to him. I had nothing left to lose. "I know you've had a difficult life but that doesn't give you the right to go around hurting people like this." By this
                                            point I was yelling at him. "I warned you!" He rose his tone as well. "I told you I was not good... but you didn't listen." "Because I cared for you!" I blurted out. Evan's eyes widened, his jaw clenched. I
                                            couldn't take it back so I continued. "I wanted to help you." "I don't need your help or your pity!" "Is this what this is about? You think I pity you?" Evan opened his mouth to say something but shut it quickly.
                                            He seemed to be choosing his words carefully. "You should probably go back to the house before you get sick." He rubbed his hand over his face and let out a long sigh. "Why are you doing this, Evan? Why do you
                                            keep pushing me away?" My voice was filled with longing and hurt. He didn't say anything; he just stared at me in silence. His lips looked so red due to our recent make-out session. For a moment, I could only
                                            hear the rain falling on us. We locked gazes, his cold faÃ§ade seemed to crack for a millisecond and I was able to see pain behind it. The deep pool of his dark eyes seemed to be endless. I wished I could know
                                            what was going through his head at that mere instant. The sadness reflecting in his eyes eased my anger a little, but it was still there, palpitating like a sleeping volcano. Trying to understand him when his
                                            actions were absolutely contradictory was so frustrating. Was this a game for him? "Go back to the house," he said in a whisper. I squeezed my wet hands regaining my anger. "So this is it?" I asked the obvious.
                                            Evan nodded. My heart sank in my chest. His careless attitude was hurting me and angering so much at the same time. I wanted to yell at him, to insult him for playing with my emotions like that. But I knew that
                                            if I spoke, my voice would crack. I was so close to start sobbing like a baby. I wouldn't take the chance to let him see me like that. I still had my dignity and pride, which was all I'd had left after the events
                                            of this night. I, Julie Ann Jones, turned on my feet and started walking away from him. It was the hardest thing I'd done in my life. It was even harder than watching my pet died when I was five. My heart ached;
                                            I could feel an empty hole in it. Mrs. Strawberry... I swallowed the lump in throat. I remembered all those nights I stayed up late chatting with him, sharing random thoughts about anything that'd come to mind.
                                            I'd always felt so comfortable when I talked to him, and I felt like I could tell him everything because he wouldn't judge me and he never did. I trusted him. I would definitely miss those random chats with
                                            him. He was my friend, he was my crush. He was many things to me, I had no idea how he got to be so important to me but the truth was, he was a part of my life now. Falling for someone over the internet sounded
                                            wrong and weird in so many levels. How can you get attached to a person without seeing his face? I probably knew the reason for it. When you are chatting with someone, you don't have to worry about those barriers
                                            that exist in the real world. You don't have to worry about looks; you don't have to pretend to be something else. You can be you without fear of being rejected; you can share things you haven't even told your
                                            best friend. Why? Because the person at the other side of the chat is looking for the same thing as you. That person wants to be listened to as much as you do. If what matters is what we truly are inside, then
                                            the internet can be a media to share that. When we are chatting, we're letting our true selves come to the surface, because that's all you've got when you can only express yourself through words. There are no
                                            masks, no need of lying, there's only you and that unknown person at the other side. A thunderclap snapped me back to reality. I was already walking down the sidewalk, sniffing and hugging myself. I was going
                                            to the opposite direction of the party. I really didn't want to go back there. I passed Lau's, Jordan's and Shane's houses but I knew they weren't there. They were at the party. Absent-minded, I headed towards
                                            the house at the end of the street. I was shivering from the cold; this was not good for my past flu. I crossed a very familiar garden filled with lilies and faced a wooden door. I knocked on it with shaking
                                            hands. I knew my lips were purple by this point. The house was quiet. What if there was no one home? As if reply, the front door swung opened. Jason stood there wearing blue shorts. His torso was naked. His
                                            hair was mess; each strand was pointing a different direction. He looked as he just woke up... "Jules?" he yawned, rubbing his left eye lazily. "What the hell?" He dropped his hand while taking in my appearance.
                                            I wanted to say something but my words drowned in my throat and I only managed to let out a shaky breath. Without hesitation, I hugged him. His bare chest and arms felt so hot against my wet skin. He smelled
                                            like honey soap. "I-I-I-" I stuttered, shaking, burying my face in his neck. "Shh, it's okay," he cooed softly, caressing the back of my head "It's alright." He pulled away and held my face. "What happened?"
                                            "I... I..." my voice kept cracking making it impossible for me to explain it to him. Jason caressed my cheek gently. "Come on, let's get you some warm clothes." He passed an arm over my shoulder and led me to
                                            his room. When we entered it, it was a mess as usual. There were clothes all over the floor, his bed was unmade. Jason gave me one of his t-shirts and a pair of shorts. They were too big for me but they were
                                            better than my damp dress. I changed in the bathroom quickly, then I got back to an empty room, drying my hair with a towel. I had no idea where Jason had gone. After sitting on the warm bed, I rubbed my face
                                            feeling emotionally and physically exhausted. Evan... The only thought of him made my heart ache so I pushed it away. Jason came back holding two cups of some hot beverage. I could see the smoke floating out
                                            of them. He had changed his shorts as well, yeah; I probably got him damp when I hugged him. He kicked the door closed and grinned at me. "I made some hot chocolate for you, milady," he stated in a royal manner,
                                            bowing like a servant. I couldn't stop the smile that crept to my lips. "Your British accent sucks big day," I teased, grasping the cup from him. Jason gasped in mock shock. "How can you say that, milady? I'm
                                            a much respected Lord in these lands." I chuckled blowing some fresh air on my hot chocolate. That was what I really loved from Jason. He could make me smile even in the worst situations. He was a cheerful guy;
                                            no matter the circumstances he could always bring a smile to my lips. Jason sat abruptly on the bed causing it to quaver. I almost spilled my chocolate. "Jason!" I whined, holding the cup tightly. "Sorry," he
                                            mumbled next to me. We were so close our arms were touching. There was a moment of silence; I knew he was waiting for me to tell him everything. I appreciated he was giving me my time to do it. Letting out a
                                            long sigh, I grasped some strength and proceeded to tell him the entire story. Jason listened to me very carefully; his green eyes never left mine, not even when he took a sip of his hot chocolate. By the time
                                            I was done, we both had finished our beverages and placed the cups on the night table. I pulled my feet inside the bed to sit Indian style and turned slightly to face my best friend. Jason mirrored me and we
                                            were soon staring at each other in silence for a while. "Alright, you're supposed to say something now," I said nervously. Jason was too serious and I didn't like that. "Jason?" I pushed, not liking his seriousness.
                                            "You do realize he's two years older than you?" he asked after a while. "Yeah. So?" I didn't know where this was going. "And you're okay with that?" he questioned skeptically. "Yes, why wouldn't I be?" Jason
                                            poked my forehead, "Because it's illegal, dumbass. You're underage." I opened my mouth forming a 'O'. "Eighteen is the age of consent here. If you and him have romantic physical contact, he could go to jail."
                                            I was too shocked to say something. How had I forgotten about that? It hadn't even crossed my mind. I wasn't really updated with my state's laws. Wait... Was that why Evan keep pushing me away? A wave of hope
                                            crossed me. That would make a lot of sense. Wait... "Is kissing considered a romantic physical contact?" That was the stupidest question that I'd ever wondered aloud. Jason rolled his eyes. "Of course." He poked
                                            my forehead again. "You seem surprised," he scowled at me. "Didn't you know this?" "Not really," I admitted, lowering my head. "Wow, this is the first time you're actually being smarter than me." Jason snickered.
                                            "I have my moments." I looked up at him and gave him a genuine smile. "You think that's the reason he keeps pushing me away?" I asked hopefully. Jason shrugged. "I don't know. It could be. He sounds like a troubled
                                            dude though, he could have other reasons." I rubbed my face, frustrated. I was tired of thinking, and my throbbing head wasn't helping. "Hey." Jason cupped my cheek. "Everything is going to be okay. I promise,"
                                            he reassured. I nodded, staring at him intently. Jason looked so cute with his bed hair. I ruffled it playfully. "I know, silly boy." I grinned at him. "Silly boy?" he cocked an eyebrow. "I thought I was being
                                            smarter than you tonight." he smiled smugly. "The moment's gone, loser." I stuck my tongue out at him. Jason narrowed his eyes at me but then a wolfish grin formed on his lips. "Is that so?" His green eyes glowed
                                            with amusement. I knew what this meant...: Tickling war! I tried to jump out of the bed but he caught me by my waist and pushed me back on it. "No!" I screamed, struggling to get free. He crawled on top of me
                                            to straddle me. "You're going down!" he exclaimed dramatically and started pinching my waist over and over again. "No!" I laughed uncontrollably. He kept tickling me non-stop. I was laughing so hard my stomach
                                            began to hurt. "Can't... breathe," I managed to say, tears of laughter rolling down the sides of my face. "Say I'm smarter than you." "No!" I refused, out of breath. "Say it!" he moved his hands faster on my
                                            waist. I was going to die of laughter if I didn't stop him. I raised my hand and grasped a fist of his hair to pull at it. I flipped him over and now it was me straddling him. I grinned triumphantly, tickling
                                            his neck. That was his weak spot. Jason laughed beneath me, trying to get me off him. "Get off, you evil girl!" He was becoming red from laughing so much. He managed to grab my wrists and stop me. We were both
                                            breathing heavily from all the effort. Jason looked into my eyes panting "Let's call it a draw, okay?" he gambled. "I believe I won." I couldn't remove the huge grin from my face. Jason's expression softened.
                                            "Fine." He let go of my wrists "I'll give you this one, only because I like making you smile like that." He pinched my nose, and I chuckled "Now, can you get off me? I can't feel my legs," he added, faking a
                                            pained expression. I shook my head and rolled off him to lie on my back. "Can I use your phone?" I asked, staring at the white ceiling. "That depends." "Depends on what?" I moved my head aside to look at him.
                                            "It depends on who you're going to call." I furrowed my eyebrows at his response. "Laura," I said. Jason handed me his Blackberry. It wasn't a surprise I knew Lau's number by heart. It rang a few times before
                                            she answered. "Hello!" she exclaimed excitedly. I could hear the party's music at the background. "Lau?" "Jules?" she seemed surprised "Where are you? Why are you calling me from..." she made a pause, I could
                                            picture her taking a look at the ID on her phone's screen. "Jason's phone?" "Because you have mine," I reminded her, rolling my eyes. I'd given Laura my phone when we left the house since the dress I'd chosen
                                            to wear didn't have any pockets whatsoever. "Right, where are you?" "I'm at Jason's house. Can you give me a ride home?" I bit my lower lip waiting for her answer. "Oh, I'm not sure I can drive. I had a couple
                                            drinks. I thought you were staying over my house." She sounded confused "Is everything alright?" "Yeah, I just want to go home." I tried to sound as cool as possible. "Why?" "I'm not feeling well," I pressed.
                                            I really didn't want to ruin her night. Lau deserved to have some fun; I could tell her my sad story in the morning. "Hold on..." I heard some voices at the background, they seemed to be talking about me "Hey,
                                            Shane says he can give you a ride." I frowned. "Really?" I didn't bother hiding the surprise in my voice. "Yeah, he'll be there soon." "Okay, have fun." "You sure you're okay?" Lau pressed, concern evident in
                                            her tone. "I'm fine, don't worry." "Okay, call me when you get home. I'll give your phone to Shane so you can get it back." "Sounds good." Realization hit me "No no, wait." Lau had already hung up. Shane was
                                            going to have my phone... My phone... That little device was like an electronic diary. Everything was saved there; my Wattpad account was open. Every single one of Evan's text was there. Oh no... Shane had not
                                            only read my actual diary, now he was going to have access to my electronic diary as well. Great, this is just great! My night just got a worse if that was even possible. I growled in frustration. Even though
                                            I wasn't a fan of Jerkpid, I appreciated his offer. "What's wrong?"Jason asked, sitting in front of his computer's desk. "Nothing," I mumbled. I knew Jason could've given me a ride if his car wasn't at the workshop.
                                            Bored, I looked at my shirtless best-friend. He seemed to be focused on the computer's screen. I narrowed my eyes when I spotted a very familiar orange label there "What are you doing?" I walked to be right
                                            behind him. My jaw dropped to the floor "You're on Wattpad?" Jason laughed nervously. "Yeah, you kept talking about it. I was curious. Turns out it's pretty cool," he admitted. I punched his shoulder. "Why didn't
                                            you tell me?" "I wanted to surprise you. What's your username?" he asked, typing on the search box. "JulesRocks." "No way!" he exclaimed in disbelief. "What?" "Mine's JasonRocks." We both laughed at our obvious
                                            lack of creativity. "High five, bestie," I said, raised my hand and grinning like an idiot. After high-fiving three times, I watched in silence whilst Jason was scrolling down my page slowly. "Wow, you have
                                            a lot fans." "Yeah, they're awesome." "What's Evan's username?" Jason opened the search box again. I hesitated to say it. I didn't know if I wanted to check his profile after what happened. What if he was flirting
                                            with that girl again? I wasn't sure I could bear with it right now. Letting out a long sigh, I told Jason the username. As soon as the browser showed up his profile, my eyes landed on his recent status. It was
                                            11 minutes ago: If you only knew... I felt something warm at the tip of my stomach. Why did I feel like that status had something to with me? My gaze dropped to his profile info. He'd changed it. It wasn't empty
                                            anymore. It had sort of a short poem there. Red lips like petals of the passion flower, That part to breathe the honeyed breath of love. Those lips that my lips gladly would devour, whose honey I would taste
                                            again thereof. I couldn't help feeling touched by his words. I wasn't sure he was talking about me but it still made my heart beat faster. Even though he'd hurt me many times, I still had feelings for that jerk.
                                            I still felt the need to comfort him. I still got warm inside reading his words. After all, he was my one and only Wattpad crush. X M W L X A/N: Yoho! :D Hope you enjoyed the chapter! There were no cliffhangers

                                            front of me moaned in my lips; but the sound didn't excite me at all, in fact it had the opposite effect. She had that kind of squeaky voice that resembled chalk scraping on a board. I kissed her harder trying
                                            to silence that annoying voice of hers but it only earned me a sonorous whimper. I ignored it as her avid hands slide under my t-shirt to caress my lower abdomen. I had her pressed against the bathroom's pottery
                                            wall. I didn't know her name but I didn't need it. I'd met her a few minutes ago in the party when my so-considerate companion ditched me. Jules... Whenever I thought about her, I got a little angry. That little
                                            blue-eyed demon definitely knew how to get under my skin. I remembered her coming out of her house looking all cute with that blue navy dress. She was anything like the models-body girls I'd been with but she
                                            had something more. She was innocent. I didn't know why I felt this urge to protect her, like she was this fragile porcelain figure who could be broken so easily. Porcelain figure? Jeez, I'm turning into a pussy.
                                            Anyways, when we'd arrived to the party, I'd gone to get her a drink to tease her about that time Melissa poured one down on her. Imagine my surprise when I came back and saw her talking to that Wattpad freak.
                                            They walked out of the living room obviously needing more privacy. That little... I'd squeezed the plastic glass so hard that vodka was dripping from my fingers. Nobody ditches me, I'm Shane Mason. I ditch people.
                                            She didn't seem to appreciate the fact I was choosing to stay by her side instead of finding some easy girl to have my way with this night. I was being nice here and no one seemed to appreciate it. So, screw
                                            niceness, I'd decided I was going to get laid and find some peace between this beautiful brunette's legs. "You are such a good kisser," the girl whispered on my mouth. Her voice came out husky. "Tell me something
                                            I don't know," I said arrogantly. She smirked and pulled at my hair to kiss me again. She tasted like cheap vodka and minty gum. Kissing her wasn't really getting me in the mood so I left her lips to kiss her
                                            neck whilst massaging her breasts. I'd always been a boobs' man so touching hers was really getting me where I wanted to be. "Shane!" Jordan's voice entered the bathroom making me jump away from the girl. "The
                                            hell, man! You scared me!" I exclaimed annoyed. "Have you drunk tonight?" His tone was urgent. "What?" I frowned "I don't know if you noticed but I'm kind of busy here." I gestured to the girl and me suggestively.
                                            "Have you drunk or not?" Jordan pressed, ignoring both the girl and my complaint. "No," I stated, remembering I wasn't really in the mood to drink after being ditched by that little minion known as Jules. "Cool,"
                                            Jordan said, and took a step out of the bathroom "Shane will take her!" he shouted at someone. "Okay!" I heard Laura's voice from the hallway. "Take who?" I scowled at my best friend. "Shane, what's going on?"
                                            the brunette asked, feeling as confused as I was. Her squeaky voice caught Jordan's attention. It was like he had finally noticed her. He eyed her for a moment and then gave her a closed mouth smile. "I think
                                            it's time for you to go," he said rudely. "What?" The girl arched her eyebrow in surprise. "Shane?" She looked at me as if waiting for me to do something. "Listen..." I started. Oh crap! I didn't know her name...
                                            did she tell me her name? The brunette waited for me to continue while Jordan watched the scene amused. "You don't remember my name, do you?" she pouted, folding her arms across her chest. She shook her head,
                                            disappointed. Names seemed to be important shit for girls. "You're a jerk!" She stormed out of the room, pushing Jordan's side in the process. I glared at him. "Thanks, man," I said sarcastically. Jordan squeezed
                                            my shoulder as we headed out of the bathroom. "She wasn't even your type," he commented. "Hey!" Laura stalked towards us. Excitement plastered on her face, "Let's dance, babe," she purred, holding Jordan's hand,
                                            shaking her hips at the music's rhythm. She hadn't stopped dancing since the very first moment we got here. Jordan stared at her dazzled. Oh man, he was whipped! "Can someone explain to me why the hell I was
                                            interrupted?" I wondered aloud, breaking their staring-at-each-other-like-fools moment. "Yeah," Jordan snapped out of her girlfriend's spell "Jules is at Jason's house." At the mention of that little devil's
                                            name, I tensed up, and anger flowed through my body "You need to give her a ride home." "Why would I do that?" I asked but was ignored by the couple. They practically ran downstairs to continue dancing. Debating
                                            with myself, I leaned against the hallway's hall. What was she doing at Jason's house? I thought she'd left with that Wattpad freak. Besides, it was pouring with rain outside. A flash of trepidation crossed
                                            me. Was she okay? I shook my head; I shouldn't worry about her, not after she ditched me. I was submerged in my thoughts. "Hey!" Laura waved her hand in front of me "I forgot to give you this." She handed me
                                            an Iphone and left as fast as she'd come. I stared at the phone, puzzled. Everything made sense when I touched the screen; the background was a picture of the little mermaid. I couldn't help the smile that crept
                                            to my lips. Yeah, this had to be Jules' phone. It reminded me of that night I was at her house and she came down stairs wearing those ridiculous, little mermaid pajamas. What was she? Five years old? Shaking
                                            my head in amusement, I noticed she had three unread texts and lots of emails from Wattpad. This could be interesting... I thought evilly but then I caught some movement from the corner of my eye. I snapped
                                            my head towards the end of the hallway. There was a guy coming out of one of the rooms. His clothes were damp; I narrowed my eyes at him. He looked familiar. He looked up at me and I instantly recognized him.
                                            It was the Wattpad freak. He stalked towards my direction in silence. There was something wrong going on here. Last time I'd seen Jules, she was with him and then she was at Jason's house, and the freak was
                                            all damp walking around here. What happened? He seemed lost in deep thought. He gave me a simple nod as a greeting and tried to get in the bathroom but I blocked his way. "Where is she?" I asked seriously. "Who?"
                                            he replied. "Jules." His shoulders tensed up as he pressed his lips in a tight line. "I don't know," he murmured coldly as he pushed me aside to enter the bathroom. I had a bad feeling about this. I went downstairs
                                            and crossed the living room as fast as the dancing crowd let me. I opened the front door, the rain had stopped finally. "Shane!" A hot brown haired girl shouted my name excitedly. She got on my way grinning
                                            from ear to ear. How did she know my name? I had no idea but it didn't really surprise me. I was popular around here. I took my time to eye this hottie but sighed disappointedly when I noticed she was intoxicated.
                                            Her blonde hair was a mess and her eyes were red. She was holding a plastic glass precariously, taking unsteady sips. "You're not going to wish me a happy birthday," she slurred. Her breath almost got me drunk
                                            right there. Oh, she was the birthday girl. "Happy birthday..." I trailed off not remembering her name. I'd seen her before at school, she was kind of hot but I sucked with names if you hadn't noticed. "Helen,"
                                            she finished for me "The name's Helen," "Right." Somehow, I manage to curl my lips upward in a semblance of a smile. "Why so lonely?" She traced her hand up my chest trying to be seductive. Drunken girls should
                                            never try being seductive, enough said. Even though she was hot, I preferred my girls sober so they could be fully conscious when I showed them a good time. Gently, I held her hand removing it from my chest.
                                            "I'm not alone," I lied. She looked surprised for a moment and then her expression turned into a sad one. "I'm sorry." She rubbed her face with her free hand and exhaled shakily. "I don't know what I'm doing."
                                            "You okay?" I asked politely. "No, I think..." her eyes were brimming with tears. Oh crap! Did I hurt her woman's pride or something? "Listen, Helen, you're hot and all but I-" "No, no, this isn't about you,"
                                            she cut me off. I stared at her confused. She held her forehead "I love him," she blurted out. I frowned. "Huh?" she seemed to notice my confusion. "I love my fuck buddy, holy shit!" She threw the plastic glass
                                            away and placed her back to me. "I screwed it up!" I had no idea what this girl was talking about but she seemed pretty upset about it. She turned to me once again "What would you do in my position?" "Your position?"
                                            "Yes," she answered, obviously, "what would you do if you fell for someone you're not supposed to fall for?" "Hum..." I really didn't know what to say to that. "Tell them?" I asked hesitantly. "But what if you
                                            knew he probably doesn't feel the same way?" "Then don't tell him." I shrugged. Yeah, I was a simple person. Helen sighed. "I pushed him away," she admitted sadly. "I didn't even invite him to my birthday. I
                                            can't love him, I just can't. He said it would always be about sex between us, nothing serious and I agreed. I can't go and tell him I want more, so much more so I ended it with him." "I'm not the most appropriate
                                            person to give a piece of advice," I started, "but you should tell him, life is about taking risks," I added as I walked past her. "Thank you," I heard her say behind me. "No problem," After having my Dr. Phil
                                            moment with Helen, I jumped inside my car. The familiar warm and peppermint scent welcomed me. Jason's house wasn't really far so I drove slowly towards it. Jules' phone was lying on the passenger seat. I glanced
                                            at it a few times curiously. Who kept texting her? Was it the freak? My hands itched to check it but I had some respect for girls' privacy. Yeah, that sounded hypocritical after that time I'd read Jules' diary,
                                            but in my defense, I was mad at her because of that time she made me fail Math. You're mad at her now for ditching you... My mind retorted trying to find an excuse to check her phone. It was too late though,
                                            I'd already parked in front of Jason's house. I honked until the front door was opened. Jules walked out of the house, looking like a boy. She was wearing a large size green t-shirt that fell past her hips and
                                            baggy shorts. Her brown hair looked darker than usual since it was wet. What happened to her dress? I narrowed my eyes at her suspiciously. Seemed like she and freaky boy had fun under the rain, huh? Why did
                                            I care anyway? Jules got on the passenger's seat, picked up her phone and closed the door. Instantly, her scent filled the car. She smelled really good, nothing compared to the alcohol, intoxicated girls from
                                            the party. She smelled sweet and mild. "Hey," she whispered shyly, averting her gaze from me. "Hey." I stared at her for a moment before driving off. "You're into transvestism now?" I joked trying to start a
                                            conversation but she didn't say anything. I stole a few glances at her but she seemed lost in thought. What was wrong with her? She wasn't usually this quiet. I pulled over at the side of the dark road and turned
                                            my body towards her. "What happened?" I asked straightforwardly. She shifted in her seat. "Nothing," she muttered, not even glancing at me. She smoothed a stray lock of her hair behind her ear, giving me a better
                                            view of her face. "Look at me," I demanded, but she kept her eyes on the window. "I'm fine." Her voice was soft, almost a whisper. I pursed my lips in frustration. "Listen, earlier you ditched me at that party
                                            and when I was finally starting to have fun again I was interrupted, because apparently, I had to pick you up, so you owe me big time. Tell me what the hell happened between you and freaky boy." "His name is
                                            Evan," she reminded me sadly. I held her face and forced her to look at me. My eyes widened. Her big blue eyes were swollen and her nose red. I clenched my jaw, a tidal wave of rage surging over me. It wasn't
                                            the first time I'd seen her like this, looking so sad, and I knew Evan was behind this. "Have you been crying?" my voice was low, laced with concern. "Yes." She looked so vulnerable. "Why?" She bit her lower
                                            lip drawing my attention to her mouth. I knew I'd always found her attractive in a cute strange kind of way but I could have never expected me to feel this uncontrollable urge boiling inside me... The irrepressible
                                            urge to kiss her... God, I wanted to lean forwards and pressed my lips against hers so bad. I wanted to taste her, to hold her and feel her against me. I wanted her. I wanted to have her for me. I didn't know
                                            if it was pure lust or something else but there was a more important question prowling in my mind: Why her? She wasn't hot or outgoing like many of the girls I'd dated before. But she was funny, sarcastic and
                                            innocent. I enjoyed hanging out with her, she was the only girl I'd spent so much time with not involving sex. However, I knew there was another reason why I wanted her; something had triggered this sudden urge.
                                            "I think," Jules' voice snapped me out my internal conflict "I think I'm falling in love with Evan," her words made my chest tightened. I looked right into her eyes, trying to hide my disappointment. I couldn't
                                            have her, but that was exactly why I wanted her now. I thought sadly as I let go of her face and drove off into the dark night. X M W L X A/N: Heya! Thank you all for the awesome support! I appreciate each time

                                            death. I love you, Mom. ~ I never really wanted you to go ~ so many things you should've known ~ My Wattpad Love Chapter 26 Jules' P.O.V Shane was too quiet. After my embarrassing confession of love for Evan,
                                            Shane hadn't uttered a word. I'd expected him to tease me about it, to make fun of me or something but not this. The rest of the ride home became truly uncomfortable. I stole a few glances at him, but his eyes
                                            were on the road, and I wasn't sure he was even blinking. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Shane looked serious. That was new. He'd never been the serious type. I couldn't understand the reason for his
                                            strange behavior but I was definitely going to find out. "Shane?" My voice sounded raspy. "Yeah?" his tone was cold; there was no trace of his usual playfulness. Alright, that was new, too. "What's wrong?" I
                                            stared at him but he didn't even glance at me. He squeezed the steering wheel. "Nothing." "You're acting weird," I commented, watching his reaction. He pressed his lips in a tight line. His shoulders were tense.
                                            I didn't need to be an expert on body language to know there was something wrong with him. Did I make him uncomfortable with the confession? I was seriously regretting telling him. I didn't know what I was thinking,
                                            I'd just blurted it out. It was like one of those moments when we realize something shocking and we can't help saying it aloud. Shane's silence was killing me; I could almost touch the tension inside the car.
                                            I stared at the window, watching the drops of rain rolling down the glass. A flash of sadness crossed me. I would never be able to see the rain without thinking about Evan. It would always remind me of that
                                            mind-blowing kiss. I'd never felt anything like this before. To be in his arms felt so good, so right. "We're here." Shane's voice snapped me out of my thoughts. I took my seatbelt off, shoved my phone in my
                                            shorts' pockets and opened the door. "Thank you," I whispered honestly. He didn't say anything so I got off the car and headed towards my house. I hugged myself, shivering from the cold. It was still drizzling
                                            a little. I opened my front door and the warmth and familiar smell of my home welcomed me. The lights were on and so was the TV which meant my mother was still awake. I had no idea what time it was. "Mom, I'm
                                            home!" I shouted, sniffing. Something smelled really good here. "I'm in the kitchen!" she shouted back. I frowned. What was she doing there? Mom wasn't really a fan of cooking. Following the delicious scent
                                            of homemade food, I found myself in the kitchen. Mom was wearing a very nice black short dress. It was really tight, highlighting her curvy figure. Her brown hair was in an elegant pony tail. She even put some
                                            make-up on. I frowned. What was going on? She bent over to get something out of the oven and placed it on the counter facing me. God, that food looked very appetizing. Was that chicken? I licked my lips. "Hey,
                                            I thought you were staying over Laura's house." She stared at me inquiringly. "Are those men's clothes?" Her eyebrows knitted together. "What happened to your dress? And why are you looking like a soaked dog?"
                                            Her expression turned into a judging one. "Julie Ann Jones, don't tell me you were out in the rain." I laughed nervously. "What?" I asked, my tone rising. That usually happened when I lied. "No, of course not."
                                            Mom narrowed her eyes at me. "You just recovered from influenza, Jules." She took her oven gloves off. "Since when are you so reckless?" I sighed. "I'm sorry, Mom, it just happened," I said. "What's going on?"
                                            I asked in a subtle attempt to change the subject. "Have you been crying?" There goes my attempt... I shifted in my seat, "No, I was..." I trailed off. "I was looking up at the sky and rain got in my eyes."
                                            Really, Jules? Really? "You really can't lie, can you?" she asked amusedly. I relaxed my shoulders in defeat. Mom's expression softened "Is this about a boy?" "Yeah," I admitted, looking down. "Sweetie, you
                                            do know you can tell me everything, right?" I nodded. "What happened?" Telling Mom my sad love story wasn't as uncomfortable as I thought it would be. She and I had always trusted each other; it'd always been
                                            the two of us. We had family in other towns but we barely kept in touch with them. Therefore, we only had each other. Of course, I skipped some details that I knew Mom wouldn't really approve, like the heat
                                            I felt when I was passionately kissing Evan under the rain. Yeah, I was sure she didn't need to know that. Mom listened to me in silence. When I was done, I felt like a huge weight had been lifted from my shoulders.
                                            "I think I know who he is," Mom whispered, deep in thought. I stared at her puzzled. "What do you mean?" "Well," she started, sitting on the stool across me, "Do you remember that week-end you had to stay over
                                            Lau's house because I couldn't come home?" I searched in my mind for that memory. "Yes, you were three days straight in the hospital. That was years ago." I furrowed my eyebrows. "Where are going with this?"
                                            "The reason I couldn't leave the hospital was because I had a very unusual terrible case to deal with," she made a pause, "We received a call from River Town's hospital, they were transferring four patients.
                                            Apparently, it was a murder case, so we, as the biggest hospital close by, had to take care of it. Besides, our hospital had more resources and specialists." My chest tightened but I listened to her attentively.
                                            "When the ambulances arrived, two of the patients were already dead. I was really shocked, Jules. They were a family. The police officer informed us of the situation. The father had shot the mother and then
                                            shot himself. Their children were coming in the other ambulance. There were a boy and girl. They were both injured. And as we proceeded to take care of them and examine them, we noticed they'd been victims of
                                            abuse for years. They had bruises and fractures. They were both traumatized, especially the boy, as he wouldn't even speak. The girl was younger than him and she wouldn't let go of him." Mom let out a long breath.
                                            "I'd never seen anything like it before. That case was in the news for months, but of course, the identity of them was hidden. They had suffered enough to be chased by the media." "You're saying..." Mom nodded.
                                            "Their names were Evan and Helen Woods," even though I knew that was where she was heading, it still surprised me when she clarified it, "I could never forget their names, their case really moved me." "Oh God."
                                            I clutched my forehead, bewilderment washing over me. Life was truly a mess. Who could've thought my own mother had treated him in the worst night of his life? God, I felt so bad for him. I couldn't even imagine
                                            what he'd been through. "Are you okay?" Mom's hand reached mine and she squeezed it reassuringly. "Yeah, this is just..." I was out of words. "I know," she whispered. "He's been through a lot, sweetie. He probably
                                            has emotional wounds that haven't healed. When a person goes through traumatic circumstances, they usually block everyone out. They are afraid of being hurt again. I'm not justifying him, but medically, his
                                            behavior is normal. He will overcome this with time, the thing is, are you really up for dealing with him?" She rested her palm on my face. "His burden has nothing to do with you. I don't want you suffering
                                            for it; you're too young for that, sweetie." "I care about him, Mom." She smiled sadly at me. "I know that. I can see it in your eyes." She caressed my cheek gently. "I can help him." "Some people don't want
                                            to be helped, Jules," she stated seriously. I closed my eyes, remembering the sadness in Evan's gaze. "I don't care," I replied, opening my eyes. Mom shook her head disapprovingly. "You're so stubborn." "I got
                                            it from you," I joked, trying to ease the sadness in me. Mom got on her feet and leaned over to kiss my forehead. "Just be smart enough to know when to give up," she said, softly leaning backwards to look into
                                            my eyes. "I know it's hard, but sometimes you just have to let it go." She started taking her apron off. It was then I remembered she was up to something. "What's the occasion?" I wondered aloud. Mom bit her
                                            lower lip nervously. "Oh, I thought you were staying over Lau's house so I..." she trailed off giving her back to me to put the apron inside one of the cabinets. "So? You decided to invite some friends to dinner?"
                                            I guessed, because she had done that before. Some friends from the hospital had come two or three times for dinner in the past few months. "Actually, I have..." she paused turning to me, "a date." My eyes widened.
                                            "A date?" I was shocked "Really?" "Yes, his name is John. He's a cardiologist at the hospital." "Oh." This was the first time Mom had a date in years. "I'm sorry, I thought you weren't coming. I didn't mean
                                            to make you uncomfortable." "Uncomfortable? Mom, I'm fine," I assured her honestly. "I just think it's kind of fast to invite him over in the first date." "Actually... it's not our first date. We've been dating
                                            for three months now." My jaw dropped to the floor. "What? And you tell me this now?" My tone rose. "I-" "We're not supposed to hide these things for each other," I cut her off, getting slightly upset. "Sweetheart,
                                            you have to understand. I wanted to know him, to see if we have some future before introducing him to you. I don't want you meeting all the guys I try a relationship with. I don't want you getting attached to
                                            a man who'll end up leaving. We had enough with your father's depart." A flash of pain crossed her eyes. "I won't put through that again." Her words eased my anger. "I'm sorry," I apologized for getting all
                                            judgmental on her. "It's okay. You weren't suppose to find out like this anyway." "Mom, it's cool. You have fun, alright? I'll go upstairs and you won't even notice I'm here. I'll meet him whenever you think
                                            it's time, there's no rush." Mom gave me a toothy smile. "You have matured for your age." "Not really, I'm still afraid of the boogeyman." Mom laughed shortly. "I love you." Her eyes shone with sincerity. "I
                                            love you too, Mom," I said before yawing. I was tired. I rubbed my face. "What a night!" I blew some hair out of my face. Mom stalked towards me. "Come here." She offered her arms and I got up to hug her. She
                                            held me tightly. I felt so safe in her arms. Her smell calmed me. "Everything is going to be alright." Even when I knew that statement was probably wishful thinking, it still calmed me to hear her say it. Mom
                                            took a step backwards and held my face with both hands "Now, you're going to take a warm shower, take two aspirins and sleep, okay? We don't want you relapsing on the flu." "Yes, sir!" I exclaimed, mocking determination.
                                            Mom pinched my nose. "Go," she shooed me, pushing me to the stairs. "Can I have some of that chicken? It looks so good." Mom chuckled at my question. "Sure, I'll give you a plate once you're showered." "Thank
                                            you!" I kissed her cheek and went upstairs. As soon as I stepped in my room, everything fell down on me. I had a lot of information to take in. I turned my night light on and sat on my bed. I stared at my closed
                                            laptop on the night table. It brought so many memories to me. I remembered the first I talked to Evan. I was so angry about the rude comment he made about my story. Who could've thought I would end up caring
                                            about him? A sad smile crept to my lips as I remembered all those nights I stayed up late, talking to him without realizing I was fascinated by him. I wanted to know more and more about him. His mysteriousness
                                            dragged me to him. Not to mention how comfortable I felt talking to him, I trusted him for no reason. I don't want to see you again... His cold words made my heart constrict. How long will this hideous overwhelming
                                            feeling last? Why did it hurt so much? Even though Mom had told me his depressing story, that wouldn't ease the pain within. He'd hurt me too much. Why was it so hard to let him go? My eyes watered. Maybe I
                                            turned into a masochist without even realizing it. Images of his handsome face flashed through my closed eyes. "Just be smart enough to know when to give up." Mom's wise recommendation roamed around my head.
                                            How could I know when to give up? Could I bear getting hurt again? How many punches could my heart take? What if Evan didn't really feel the same way and that was why he kept pushing me away? Maybe I was fooling
                                            myself for thinking he actually had feelings for me. Tears streamed down my face. Love makes us fools. Sighing, I let myself fall backwards on my bed. I could hear the rain hitting my window's glass. Evan...
                                            Evan... What are you doing right now? Where are you? Are you thinking about me? What should I do? Mrs. Strawberry... I covered my face to sob softly. I was swallowed by the memory of all the things he'd said
                                            to me... You're the opposite of me. I like you You're beautiful Writers always leave pieces of themselves on the story. We're miles away. Why would he do this to me? Why would he push me away like this? I wished
                                            I could enter his mind, I wished he knew I was more than willing to help him, to be there for him whenever he needed me. I couldn't imagine the pain he'd endured but I was willing to listen to him. He didn't
                                            have to be alone in this. It could be my way of paying him back for all those nights he listened to my endless babbling. I uncovered my face and opened my eyes. My sight was blurred 'cause of the tears. I blinked,
                                            letting them escape my eyes. My phone buzzed in my shorts' pocket. I had totally forgotten about it. I pulled it out to check it. Anticipation made my mouth dry as my eyes landed on the unread texts and mails
                                            from Wattpad. I proceed to read the texts but I was instantly disappointed when I read the IDs. There were three texts from Jason and one from Laura. Jason's texts were from earlier, asking me about Helen's
                                            party. That was probably before I showed up sobbing at his door. Lau was asking if I got home alright. I texted her back telling her I was okay. Sorrowfully, I checked the email's list. I felt a pull at the
                                            top of my stomach as I read that familiar e-mail: Dark_poet001 sent you a message: It is for your own good. I'm sorry. My own good? Didn't he know I wasn't good at all without him? The message was 14 minutes
                                            ago. I hesitated about my reply. I didn't know if I was ready to talk to him. I wanted to tell him so many things. I wanted to yell at him. Couldn't he let me make my own choices? Angrily, I typed a reply: Why
                                            would you play with my feelings like that? Him: I'm sorry. Me: Stop saying that. Him: ..... Me: Why...? Him: Did you get home alright? Me: Like you care. Him: Just tell me. Me: I'm fine. Him: Good. Me: Evan...
                                            Him: You need to forget about me. Me: No, no until you tell me why. My heart was racing inside my chest. I literally stopped breathing each time he replied. Him: I already told you. Me: You never gave me your
                                            reasons. Him: I didn't need to. Me: You owe me an explanation. Him: I don't owe you anything. Me: Why would you lead me on like that if you felt nothing for me? Him: I was just fooling around. I ignored the
                                            stabbed I felt in my chest when I read that. Me: Was this a game for you? Him: Yes. Me: I don't believe you. Him: I don't care. Me: ... Him: I have to go. Me: Don't. Him: I'm sorry. Dark_poet001 logged off.
                                            Desperately, I searched through my contacts and found his number. I called him biting my lower lip nervously; my heart was going to jump out of my chest.I thought he wasn't going to answer but after the third
                                            ring, I was surprised to hear his sexy voice. "Hello?" "Evan, I-" "Stop this, Jules." His tone was soft, but tinged with pain. "I can't." "What do you want from me?" "I want answers... that's all." Evan sighed.
                                            "Jules..." "Evan, please," I pleaded pathetically. Why did love make us so weak? God, I was being clingy. "I'm not good, Jules." "That's not true," I retorted. I heard him sigh again, he sounded so troubled.
                                            "What am I going to do with you?" he whispered, his husky voice sent shivers through me. "Just be with me." "I can't." "Why?" "I just... you should get some sleep." He tried to sound cold but I could still sense
                                            the sadness lining his voice. "Promise me, I will see you again and we will talk." "I can't promise that." "Evan..." "Goodnight, sweet Jules." He hung up but I still held the phone pressed against my ear. My
                                            heart was beating really fast inside my chest. I lay back on my bed and gazed at the ceiling. I was numb for a moment. My phone buzzed in my hand and I raised it to my face. It was a text from Evan; I stopped
                                            breathing whilst I read it: You're driving me crazy, Mrs. Strawberry. X M W L X A/N: Hello! How are you doing? I hope you're enjoying winter/summer/whatever season is where you live! xD I'm really grateful for

                                            Chapter 27 "Evan..." I whispered, leaning to him. I wanted to feel his lips against mine. Evan smiled at me. "You are so cute, Jules." His sexy voice made me shiver. "Kiss me," I demanded, wrapping my arms around
                                            his neck. Our lips were about to meet... "Jules!" someone screamed right in my ear. I jumped awake; I held my chest as I sat up. Lau was standing next to me, grinning wickedly. "Arg! Lau! I was having a good
                                            dream!" I whined throwing my pillow at her. She chuckled. "I'm sorry but it's past noon, time to wake up," she said casually, sitting on the edge of my bed. "It's Sunday," I reminded her, annoyed. "I can sleep
                                            late on Sundays." "Not when you have some explaining to do." She folded her arms across her chest. I frowned. "What are you talking about?" "What happened last night?" she inquired, staring at me. "Long story,"
                                            I replied, rubbing my face. "I have all day to listen." "Can I brush my teeth first?" I asked, irritated. I didn't get in my best mood when someone woke me up. Lau gestured me towards the bathroom. "Sure, but
                                            I won't go away and you know it." I rolled my eyes and got out of bed. After doing my routine in the bathroom, I walked out scratching my butt. I was sure a part of my brain was still asleep. To my surprise,
                                            Lau was not alone anymore. Jason was lying on my bed as if it was his. "Hey, we brought you breakfast." Jason sat up, smiling at me. "Well, more like lunch." He frowned, probably remembering it was the afternoon.
                                            "The point is, we brought you food." "What's going on?" I asked, eyeing them suspiciously. "Why are you two here?" Lau and Jason exchanged knowing glances. "Are you okay?" Jason asked seriously. "Yeah, why wouldn't
                                            I be?" They seemed surprised by my reply. "I don't know. I thought heartbreak was very painful," Jason commented. Heartbreak... Evan... Everything came down on me. My heart shrunk in my chest as I remembered
                                            all the events from last night. I held back some tears and pretended a smile. "I'm okay," I lied. Lau shook her head, smiling sadly at me. "We've been your best friends since kindergarten." Lau stood up. "I'm
                                            pretty sure we can tell whenyou're lying. Come here." She offered her arms to me. I hugged her tightly. "I'm sorry for not being there for your last night." I knew she was being honest. "It's okay. You didn't
                                            know." I pulled away from her. "I should've known there was something wrong when you called me," she spoke softly, guilt plastered on her face, "but I was so submerged in that party." She sighed "I'm really
                                            sorry," "Lau." I held her face "It's cool, really. You have the right to have fun, you're here now and that's all that matters." Jason cleared his throat. "Sorry to interrupt your Beverly Hills' TV show moment,
                                            but Jules, your food is getting cold," he said, pinching my food. "Hey! Hands off the food!" I exclaimed, approaching to him. "Calm down, woman!" He seemed scared. He knew better than to mess with my food. I
                                            proceeded to eat and tell Lau the entire story. Jason already knew most of it so he simply stayed on my bed texting someone. Lau listened to me attentively. I felt a soft thug of pain in my stomach when I told
                                            her the painful parts. I had to pause to swallow the lump in my throat a few times. It was hard talking about it but it felt kind of good to vent all my feelings. "So that's all," I finished, letting out a long
                                            sigh. Feeling my dry throat, I took a sip from the orange juice they'd brought me. "Wow." Lau ran her fingers through her hair. "Nothing is easy when it comes to that boy, is it?" "Nope," I stated, popping the
                                            'p'. "You want to hear my opinion?" she offered, holding her chest. "No, Lau, I just spent half-an-hour of my life telling you the entire story just for the fun of it," I said sarcastically. Lau pinched my waist.
                                            I jumped away from her. "No need to be sarcastic, alright?" she reprehended before continuing, "I'm just saying, you know me. My opinion will be brutally honest, are you ready for that?" I knew what she meant.
                                            Lau wasn't the go around the bush type of girl. She didn't like embellishing the things she said. "I'm ready." I nodded my head slowly. "In my opinion, he's being an indecisive jerk and you're being weak and
                                            needy." My eyes widened. "It's pretty obvious he's a very reserved, closed-up guy, probably because of his past but he needs to stop toying with your heart like this. It's like that hot and cold song from Katy
                                            Perry," "You like Katy Perry? Since when?" I asked shocked. "Yeah, but that's not the point. He obviously likes you, I mean, he kissed you for a reason but he's probably scared or something. Guys can be pretty
                                            confusing sometimes. As for you my dear friend, you need to stop being so clingy, okay?" "What do you mean?" "Boys don't like clingy, whiny girls, Jules," she explained seriously. "She's right," Jason agreed
                                            from behind me. "I'm not being clingy," I retorted. Lau cocked an eyebrow. "Yes, you are. You're clinging to him like you did with that hideous teddy bear you had when you were seven." I opened my mouth in surprise.
                                            "Hey! It wasn't hideous and it was a panda," I defended indignantly. Lau rolled her eyes as Jason snickered behind me. "It was hideous," Jason agreed. I folded my arms across my chest. "Wasn't!" I retorted childishly.
                                            "Was!" Lau poked my forehead. "You still have it, don't you?" Jason wondered, pulling at my hair. "Pssst!" I exclaimed nervously. "Of course not! I'm a big girl now." My tone was too loud. Jason and Lau exchanged
                                            glances. "She still has it," both of them said at the same time. "This isn't about Pedro, we were-" "Pedro?" they burst into laughing. I glared at them "You named it Pedro?" Lau asked, laughing her ass off.
                                            Their loud laughs were kind of contagious. I was biting my lower lip not to join them but couldn't help bursting into laughing as well. Yeah, Pedro wasn't really the cutest name for a teddy bear, but hey, I
                                            was seven at the time, okay? We laughed for a while until there were tears streaming down my face. Somehow I ended up resting my head on Jason's lap. I wiped my tears away. Lau composed herself and for a moment
                                            she seemed to be deep in thought. "Lau?" I caught her attention. "I have a plan." She finally snapped out of her thoughts. "A plan?" "Yes, you need to stop your clingy attitude, alright?" She held her chin staring
                                            at some point at the wall. "Don't message him. Leave him alone. If it's possible, ignore him. That will be like a bucket of cold water to him because you've never been cold to him. You've always been there for
                                            him so he needs to think he lost you. That will make him come to you by himself." "And if he doesn't?" I whispered sadly. "Then sadly, you'll have to let him go because he obviously doesn't care enough about
                                            you if he doesn't react at your change of attitude." I took a deep breath in. "But I don't know If I can't stop myself from messaging him," I admitted. "We will help you," Lau grinned at me, "we'll keep you
                                            distracted." "I appreciate the effort, but guys, you two have lives and relationships to take care of. You can't be with me all day." "The hell we can." Jason got on his feet, rubbing her hands manically. "We're
                                            gonna be like your bodyguards, and for the record, I'm not in a relationship." I narrowed my eyes at him. "Seriously, Jason? When are you going to admit you're crazy about Helen?" "He what?" Lau opened her mouth
                                            and punched his shoulder. "Jay-Jay has been caught!" she joked. Jason ruffled her hair. "I hate that nickname," he muttered. "I know, Jay-Jay," she teased, taking a step away from him. "By the way, you and Jason
                                            are really ignorant when it comes to know about the law," I scowled at her. "Why?" "The law clearly states that it's illegal to have sex with a minor if you're over 18. It doesn't say anything about kissing
                                            or having a relationship," she clarified. "Really?" I glared at Jason. "You idiot!" I threw my other pillow at him. "And to think I thought you were actually being smart when you told me Evan and I couldn't
                                            be together because of the law." Jason scratched the back of his head. "You shouldn't have trusted my words, you know me." He shrugged his shoulders. Lau let herself fall on my bed. "You're lucky to have me,"
                                            she added arrogantly "Jason's IQ is as small as his penis." "Lau!" I scrunched my nose in disgust remembering the two times I had unfortunately seen his little buddy. I couldn't help the blush invading my cheeks.
                                            "You don't know the size of my penis!" Jason jumped on top of her angrily. Lau laughed trying to push him off. "But it's okay if you wanna find out." He winked down at her. Lau made a disgust face. "Ew! Get
                                            off me!" I watched the scene in amusement. Jason smiled wickedly at her. "You enjoy having me this close," he teased, tickling her. "No!" She trashed around, trying to get him off. They stopped moving and stared
                                            into each other's eyes breathing heavily. For a slight moment, Jason's gaze dropped to her lips. Whoa whoa... What? He quickly jumped off her, fixing his t-shirt. "I gotta go now," he rushed his words. Lau sat
                                            up brushing her messy hair with her fingers. "Bye, Jay-Jay." She stuck her tongue out at him. Jason gave her a killer look and looked at me. "Call me if you need anything, alright?" He came closer and kissed
                                            my forehead tenderly. "Okay." We watched him leave and then my eyes landed on my best friend. "Ok," I started. "What the hell was all that about?" "What?" Lau played the fool. "You and Jason." "Huh?" "Lau, I
                                            just witnessed my two best friends flirting... hard, so what the hell?" "We weren't flirting." She averted her gaze. "Look into my eyes," I demanded, crawling closer to her. Her big green eyes met my blue ones."What.
                                            Was. All. That. About?" I said each word slowly. Lau swallowed, her cheeks tinted slightly red. "It's just innocent flirting." "What? Lau, you have a boyfriend!" "I know. I know. I'm not saying I like Jason
                                            or anything. We're just used to do this sometimes, it won't happen again." "It better not." I gave her a disapproving look. "It's just an old habit, it won't happen again, alright?" "Fine." I smiled at her.
                                            "How's Jordan?" Lau's face brightened up. "We're good. You have no idea how sweet he can be behind that arrogant attitude." Her words reminded me of Shane. Did he have a sweet side like Jordan? I bet a bag of
                                            Ruffles he didn't. We spent the rest of the afternoon talking about random things. I introduced her to Wattpad once again but she refused to create an account. She said she was too lazy to do it. I didn't know
                                            anything about Evan since I was following Lau's advice. I really hoped it worked out. ** This wasn't working out. I was in hell. The week rushed by and I hadn't even got one single message from Evan. I was dying
                                            inside slowly and painfully. Ok I was probably being dramatic but this was pure torture. I put on a strong facade in front of Jason and Lau, but truth was, I was having a hard time. My fingers itched for texting
                                            him, for checking his wattpad profile. Holding myself back was not a easy thing to do. It was Friday's afternoon already. I was walking to the parking lot lazily. I really hoped Lau hadn't ditched me since she
                                            was my ride home. Crossing the football field, I remembered that day Evan gave me a ride home. I remembered our first kiss. I sighed, running my fingers through my hair. I was afraid of scanning the parking
                                            lot, what if he was there? What was I supposed to do? I lifted my gaze to check the parking lot; I had no idea of where Lau's car was parked. My heart jumped in my chest as my eyes spotted a very familiar black
                                            car... Evan's car. I tried to maintain my regular breathing but my chest was already rising and falling quickly. I squeezed my hands at my sides nervously. My throat was awfully dry. Calm down... I hadn't even
                                            seen him and I was about to die of a heart attack. What if that wasn't his car? It had to be, I hadn't seen a similar car around before. Oh God! He had to be around if his car was there. Breathe, Jules. You're
                                            overreacting. Overreacting my ass! I wasn't prepared for this. Lau hadn't obviously considered this possibility. One thing was not to message him but what was I supposed to do if I saw him? Ignore him, too?
                                            With shaking hand, I took my phone out of my pocket to text Lau: Where are u? Lau: End of the parkin lot. Come. I felt relieved because she didn't leave without me. Ok, I could do this. Evan was not around right
                                            now, I just needed to cross the parking lot and everything would be over. Why the hell am I not moving? When my legs finally responded to me, I found myself walking through the cars. There were cars at both
                                            of my sides, some students were gathered around their cars talking, and some were already leaving. Sunset was falling all over us, tilting the sky orange and pink. I swallowed when I passed Evan's car. I can
                                            do this... I can do th- I stopped on my tracks abruptly. Evan... he was walking right towards me. My stomach did a major black-flip. God, I forgot how hot he was. He was wearing a leather jacket with dark blue
                                            t-shirt underneath. His dark hair was messy partially falling down his forehead a little. His intense gaze fell on me freezing me on the spot. He was walking in my direction, probably heading to his car. He
                                            had his hands inside his jacket's pocket. As he came closer I couldn't help noticing the bags under his eyes. I knew I had to move. He was staring at me shamelessly, not bothering to dissimulate. I felt like
                                            he was seeing right through me. It was then I realized how bad I wanted to kiss him again, to feel those lips against mine, to have him close. Move! My inner voice yelled at me. I knew I had to ignore him but
                                            I was dying to talk to him, to hear his sexy voice. I missed him so much. But I was also afraid of getting hurt again so grasping some courage, I started moving towards him. I couldn't remove my eyes from him
                                            though. His expression was unreadable as usual. Evan slowed down a little bit when I was getting closer to him as if he expected me to stop or say something. Ignoring my protesting heart, I walked past him averting
                                            my gaze. Getting away from him like that was one of the hardest things I'd done in my life. When I reached Lau's car, she was sitting on the hood alone, playing with her keys. "You look like you're about to
                                            pass out," she said jumping off the hood. I wanted to speak but no words left my mouth "You okay?" I shook my head "What's wrong?" I walked around her to get on the passenger's seat. Lau frowned but ran to jump
                                            in the driver's seat. Once we were inside the car, she turned her body to me "What happened?" "I saw him," I mumbled. "What?" "I saw him," I said louder this time. "Evan?" "Yes," "Oh," Lau exclaimed in realization,
                                            "Did you...?" "I ignored him." I clutched my forehead trying to calm down. "Really?" Lau didn't bother to hide the shock on her face. "Wow, that's... great." I gave her a flat look. "Sorry, but that was the
                                            best thing to do right now." "I know," I sighed. "Don't worry, you'll probably seen him again tomorrow." "What?" I snapped my heard towards her. "River town's festival is tomorrow and we are so going." "You
                                            mean that weird festival they do at the river's borders?" "Yup." Lau started starting the engine. "What if he doesn't go?" I wondered sadly. "He will, everyone is going," Lau assured me seriously. She drove
                                            off the parking lot and I kept my head down. I knew I had done the right thing but I still felt bad about it. My phone buzzed in my hand making jump a little in my seat. It was a text from Evan. I hesitated
                                            to open it. My heart was pumping blood really fast through my veins. Waves of expectation and curiosity were washing over me. From: Evan
                                            <!--3   


Why can't we be friends?    

His question caught me out of guard. I couldn't believe he was bringing up that friend thing again. I showed Lau the text.   

"Tell him you're going to be his friend," she recommended.   

"What?"   

"Listen, he just took a step. He texted you even when he said he didn't want to see you again which is obviously a lie. He's looking for an excuse to have you close without complications. So, be his friend. He likes you, he will eventually crack, okay?"   

"But I don't want to be his friend."   

"I know that and I bet he really doesn't want that either but you have to be smart, Jules. Having him close can provide you from a lot of opportunities to tease him, to make him jealous until he finally finds the courage to tell you the way he truly feels about you."   
 I sighed, burying myself deeper in my seat.   

"Sounds easier said than done," I commented, rubbing my face.   

"Trust me on this, okay?"   

"Okay," I agreed, starting to text him back.   

Me: Okay, Evan, we will be friends.   


Him: Really?   

Me: Yeah.   


Him: I'm really sorry.   

Me: ?   


Him: For hurting you.   

His apology warmed my heart.   

Me: It's cool.   


Him: I really didn't mean to.   

Me: I know.   

"Ask him if he's going to the festival." Lau's voice filled the silent car.   

Me: Are you going to the festival tomorrow?   


Him: No.   

Me: That's too bad.   


Him: Why? Are you going?   

Me: Yeah.   


Him: I guess I could drop by for a few minutes.   

A smile crept to my lips.   

Me: Sounds cool.   


Him: I've got something for you.   

Me: Really?   


Him: Yes, it's kind of an apology present or something like that.   

Me: That's... sweet but you didn't need to buy me anything.   


Him: I know but I wanted to.   

Me: Alright, you can give it to me tomorrow then.   

I bit my lower lip.   


Him: Okay, peachy girl ;)   

I smiled like a fool, shaking my head. His nicknames were so weird.   

Me: I'll see you tomorrow, dark poet.   


Him: I'll be the one with the killing body and handsome face ;)   

I laughed loudly.   

Me: Right (rolls eyes)   

It felt so good to talk to him. It made me feel better even though we'd just agreed to be friends. Lau was right; I needed to find a way to get him to open up to me. Pushing him had definitely not worked so now I would try being his friend. It wasn't going to be easy but I could least try, right?   

That festival was going to be interesting.

 My Wattpad Love  

Chapter 28    

Two words.  

Bathing suits.  

I'd never felt comfortable wearing them. Seriously, what's the different between them and underwear? None. So excuse me if I wasn't a fan of walking basically in my underwear around people. Besides, you need a lot of self confidence to wear a bathing suit.   

Even though, my protests and good arguments against those things, Lau made me wear one. She said everyone was going to be wearing them at the festival. Let me tell you something, my best friend was as stubborn as me, if not more.   

So here I was, sitting on Jordan's car backseat wearing blue shorts, a loose white t-shirt and a dark blue bathing suit beneath. Lau said it matched my eyes. She also had straightened my brown hair making it curly at the ends. I felt good about my looks today.  Jordan was the designed driver for the day; Lau was of course sitting next to him. And guess who was being my company on the backseat?   

Yeah, you guessed it right.  

Jerkpid.   

Shane was looking all hot with his jean shorts and green t-shirt but that didn't surprise me. Somehow, I'd grown used to be around him and his hotness.   

"Here we go!" Jordan exclaimed enthusiastically as he started driving into the road.   

"Yeah!" Lau was as enthusiastic as her boyfriend. I, on the other hand, was kind of nervous about seeing Evan again "Take us there, babe!" Lau cheered leaning to kiss Jordan. He leaned to her and kissed her back.   

"Hey!" I pressed my hand on Lau's forehead to push her away from Jordan "Could you just not make out while driving, please?" They both laughed. Lau looked really good. She was only wearing shorts and the top part of her bathing suit. She had enough self-confidence to go around like that unlike me. Her hair was in a pony tail and she had sunglasses on. She turned her head to me and flashed me a smile.   

"You look kind of pale." she commented "You definitely need some sun." I glared at her. Shane snickered beside me. Was he still weird with me like last time I saw him?   

"I can't wait to see you without all that clothes, Jones." Shane said, smirking at me.  

No, he was definitely same old Shane.  

"I prefer keeping my clothes on, thank you very much." I stated bluntly folding my arms across my chest. I could feel Shane's eyes on me.   

"And exactly what's your plan?" He asked crawling closer to me "Get in the river fully dressed and make a fool of yourself?"  

"Who says I'm getting in the river?" I shrugged my shoulders. Lau and Jordan were talking, ignoring us.   

"Well,", Shane's breath was tickling my ear "You'll be wet by the end of the day, Jones. I can assure you that." I shivered. I looked at him, which was a grave mistake. He was too close for my liking. His green feline eyes stared right into mine intensively. I pushed his chest.  

"Back off, Jerkpid!" I covered my mouth as I said it. Shane cocked an eyebrow.  

"What did you just call me?" The amusement in his voice was annoying.  

"Nothing," I mumbled looking at the window. It was sunny outside. It was a great day for the festival.   

"Jerkpid?" Shane asked amusedly "Gotta admit you're creative, babe," I snapped my head towards him.  

"Don't call me babe,"   

"You know you like it." he teased, cupping my cheek.  

"I don't," I slapped his hand. He chuckled and grasped a lock of my hair to play with. Having him this close was making me nervous.   

"Leave her alone, man." Jordan chimed in glancing at us through the rear-mirror. Shane let go of my hair and raised his hands in peace.  

"Fine," he gave me my space and I was thankful for it.   

"Thank you, Jordan." I smiled at him through the rear mirror.  

"No problem."   

The rest of the ride was kind of fun. Jordan was really funny. Even though his jokes were lame. The way he told them made us all burst into laughter. I couldn't help noticing how his eyes glowed whenever he glanced at Lau. He really liked her, I could tell. Shane, on the other hand, wouldn't stop making fun of me and my shyness.   

By the time we arrived to the festival, I was fuming about some joke Shane made about my hair. Yeah, my hair was a very sensitive subject for me and he knew it. I jumped off the car but was suddenly overwhelmed by the view. This festival seemed to be a very big deal.   

The river was wide and mighty, surrounded by tall trees. Its water was a combination of blue and green. There were balloons tied to the trees and a big sign that said "welcome to River Town's festival" I gawked at a decorated wooden bridge that crossed the river. There were people at both sides. The sun was bright up in the sky, making the water crystalline; you could see the bottom of the river in the shallow parts. Wow, there was a lot of people here, most of them teenagers. There were booths all around as if it was a carnival. I wondered what they were selling in them.   

"You like it?" Lau asked wrapping an arm around my shoulders. I nodded, closing my mouth. I noticed all the girls walking around in their bathing suits. There were shirtless boys with plastic glass in their hands. This looked more like a party than a festival. The music was pretty loud. Shane appeared at my side, strecheting his arms.  

"Ready to get loose, babe?" he asked grasping the hem of his t-shirt to pull it over his head. Unconsciously, my eyes roamed around his biceps, chest and eight-pack. It was understandable why he was the school's player, I mean, with that marvelous body he could easily be a model "Stop raping me with your eyes, Jones," his arrogant voice snapped me out of my inappropriate thoughts. I blushed looking at my other side where Laura was watching me with a diverted expression. She wiggled her eyebrows.  

"He's hot, isn't he?" she whispered conspiratorially.   

"Yeah," I admitted smiling shyly.  Jordan pushed us apart to get between us.  

"Are you ready, ladies?" he grinned at the sight "The river looks good. Let's go!" he wrapped his arms around both us to pull us forward.  Remember I had no skills whatsoever when it came to walk on a rocky surface? Well, river banks are usually rocky so yeah, you get the picture.   

It was a good thing Jordan was a fast catcher otherwise I would've ended up falling too many times to count. The worst part was that we weren't even half of way and I was already breathing heavily as if I ran a marathon. Walking on a rocky surface should be a sport, enough said! Shane was laughing at me, of course, the entire way. I wanted to glare at him but I couldn't take my eyes off the rocks. We stopped walking because Lau wanted to take her short off. I rested my hands on my knees trying to catch my breath.  

I hate rocks!  

Maybe, they hated me. It could be a mutual thing.   

"My stomach hurts," Shane said caressing his abs

"I think I laughed enough for the day," he approached to me with long strides. He didn't seem to mind the rocks "come here, clumsy girl," I scowled at him.  

"What ar-Ah!" Shane lifted me to carry me bridal style "Put me down!" I exclaimed embarrassed.   

"No," he started moving to the river.  

"Shane! Put me down!" I pushed his chest, feeling the muscles beneath. He looked down at me and grinned.  

"That way, you won't ruin my day by falling and hitting your head,", he explained casually. I glared at him but he simply winked at me.   

"I hate you,".  

"Hate is a powerful feeling, I can work with that,". I decided to ignore him the rest of the way.   

When we finally got to the river bank, Shane put me down. I took a step away from him and folded my arms across my chest. I could feel the sand getting in my sandals.   

"You're an ungrateful little minion," he shook his head, poking my forehead.  

"Little minion?"   

"Yes, you're not the only one creative in this relationship, babe,"  

"There's no relationship here!" I gestured both of us "and stop calling me babe,"   

"Whatever you say," he waved me off, shrugging.   

If looks could kill...  

"Yoho!" Lau showed up in all her almost naked glory. Jordan was already shirtless, holding his girlfriend's hand possessively.   

"Hey, you made it," Jordan ruffled my hair as if I was a child. I gave him a closed mouth smile.  

"Why do you still have your clothes on?", Lau asked, tugging my t-shirt. I ran my fingers through my hair.   

"I..." I trailed off "I'll take them off later,"  

"Water is going to be too cold later, Jules," Lau assured "right now, it's the perfect time to go for a swim," I ran out of arguments therefore I slowly took my t-shirt off. I could feel my flaming cheeks as I kept my hands over my chest trying to cover myself. I didn't have big boobs, they weren't too small either, they could fill a hand I guess "that's better!" Lau encouraged "Let's go!" she said heading to the river, pulling Jordan with her. I wasn't getting in the river anytime soon so I sat on a rock. Sunlight was brushing my skin, warming me up.   

Ah! This feels good.  

A red headed came closer and started talking to Shane, flirting with him shamelessly. I rolled my eyes, typical. My phone buzzed in shorts pocket. I took it out nervously. I knew it was a text from Evan. How did I know? Add it to the list of mysteries in Julie Ann Jones' life. However, I was not expecting to read these words.  

Blue suits you :)    

Oh God! He saw me?!   

I was officially looking like a tomato right now. I lifted my gaze and scanned the crowd surrounding the river but didn't see him.   

Me: Where are u? 


Him: Planet Earth :)  

I narrowed my eyes at my phone's screen.  

Me: Ha! Hilarious. 


Him: Cross the bridge ;)  

What? I looked at the wooden decorated bridge, it wasn't that far. I checked the way and it only had sand so phew! No more rocks.   

Me: Okay.  

I shoved my phone inside my pockets, took my sandals off and started walking through the sandy riverbank. Shane seemed too busy to notice my sudden depart. I kept my eyes on the sand, trying to be invisible. I should've have put my t-shirt on again. I couldn't believe I'd left it on some random rock. I embraced myself and rubbed my arms. The view from the bridge was breathtaking.  You could see all the way up the river and the bright sun shielded by mountains. The sound of water running was refreshing. A cool breeze brushed my hair softly. it was so good to be out of my house. This place was pretty cool.   

As soon as my feet landed on the other side of the river, I texted Evan asking him where he was again.  


Him: Walk deeper into the woods..  

Me: What direction? 


Him: Just walk straight :)   

This side of the river wasn't as rocky as the other. The sand felt soft under my bare feet. I was soon swallowed by tall trees that hid the sun from me. I stopped on my tracks realizing I was far enough from civilization to be worried about my safety. What if I got the wrong direction? What if got lost? What if there was an angry panda waiting for  me there?  


There are no pandas here, dumb-ass!   My inner voice snapped at me. I heard some noise behind me so I turned on my heels in a fast move.  

Nothing...  

"Evan?" I called him out because I was starting to get scared. Who am I kidding? I was one minute from running away like a scared puppy. Yeah, I wasn't a brave person besides, I'd watched too much discovery channel to know there could be a snake waiting to inject its poison in my bare feet or an angry bear looking for food. Something warm was wrapped around my waist so I screamed but my mouth was soon covered. the familiar smell of lavender softener hit my nostrils... Evan. He let me go and I turned around angrily, ready to yell at him for scaring me like that. But when my eyes landed on his handsome face, I was speechless. He was wearing a sleeveless black t-shirt, shorts and black converses. His hair was tousled giving him a sexy disheveled look. The tattoo on his neck was visible, adding more to his bad boy appearance. I looked into his dark eyes and swallowed.  

"You're not really brave, are you?" he teased, smiling. Oh God, the dimples on his cheeks formed taking my breath away.   

"I..."   

Breathe, Jules.  

"You scared me!" I accused trying to sound angry but failing miserably. How could I be angry at him when he smiled like that? that wasn't fair! He should be banned for smiling. Evan chuckled.  

"It's not my fault you're a chicken,"   

"I'm not a chicken!", I retorted folding my arms across my chest, causing Evan's gaze to drop to my boobs for a slight second before going up to my face again. Damn! I forgot I was shirtless. My cheeks reddened as I tried to compose myself.   

"You're going for a swim?", he asked, tilting his head to the side.  

"Not really,"  

"Why not?"   

"Well... swimming is not my thing," I lied. Truth was, I couldn't swim but It's not like I'm telling him that. I mean, he lived in River town, swimming was probably natural for him. Evan narrowed his eyes at me, as if he was scrutinizing me.  

"You can't swim, can you?" how did he know? Arh! I really sucked at lying. I shook my head ashamed "That's not bad. It only means I have more to teach you," he smirked. My heart skipped a beat.   

"More to teach me?"   

"Yeah,". he took a step closer. I had to tilt my head back to look at him.  

"So now you're the experienced bad boy," I said mocking seriousness.   

"More like the experienced good-looking bad boy,". his arrogance made me roll my eyes.  

"Get over yourself," I poked his chest playfully. He held my hand, the contact sent shivers through me. I retracted my hand, smiling nervously "So, any particular reason you brought me to this isolated place?"   

"Yes, I'm going to kill you," he affirmed hiding a smile "I must say, you were very easy to catch,"  

"You're going to kill me and throw my body in the river?" I asked shaking my head disapprovingly

"That's so cliche"  

"Life is a big walking cliche, peachy girl," his hand cupped my cheek. I swallowed.  

"Why are we here?" I sounded a little bit breathless.   

"Close your eyes," his thumb caressed my cheek gently. I did as I was told "Give me your hand,". Slowly, I lifted my hand. He held it opened and placed something cold on my palm. Curiosity was getting the best of me. I was struggling not to see what it was. "Open your eyes, Jules," he whispered looming over me. As soon as I opened my eyes, I looked at my hand and gasped. There was a beautiful golden necklace on it.  It had a big strawberry shaped pendant. I covered my mouth with my free hand, hiding the dreamy smile on my lips "I'm truly sorry," he said, honesty dripping from his tongue.  

"Wow... this is...." I didn't know what to say. I wasn't used to get presents. I didn't expect Evan to have such a detailed gesture.   

"Check the inscription," he spoke excitedly. I grasped the medium size strawberry pendant and turned it over to read the inscription.  It read:   

To the beautiful 

Mrs. Strawberry

E.W.  

My heart melted inside my chest. How could he do things like this and expect me to be his friend? No one had ever given me something like this before. It was so meaningful. it wasn't just some random necklace. He found a way to make it unique, to relate it to me. I looked up at him. He was giving me a genuine smile. I wanted to close that space between us and pressed my lips against his, I wanted to show him how much he meant to me, to let him know how much I cared about him. I knew he had internal conflicts, i knew he was troubled guy but I didn't care. I would do the impossible to remove that sadness from his eyes. Even when he was smiling I could clearly see the hidden sadness in the depth of his eyes... it was almost imperceptible.   

"Did you like it?" his question interrupted my thoughts. I blinked getting back to reality.   

"I love it...It's beautiful," I answered frankly. He took the necklace from my palm to put on my neck gently. The cold gold met my bare skin, I couldn't help shivering. Evan took a step backwards and grinned.  

"It looks great on you,"  

"Thank you," I mumbled with a flustered face "This is... really sweet of you,". He scratched the back of his head.  

"Yeah, I guess your sweetness is contagious," he stated, making a disgusted face. I punched his shoulder.  

"Silly dark poet!" I exclaimed playfully.  

"Naive cheesy writer," He stuck his tongue out at me.  

"Oh, very mature, huh?" Evan opened his mouth to say something but then someone else spoke.  

"Finally!" I turned around to find Shane. He was dripping wet "I've been looking for you everywhere, babe," Evan tensed up at the word 'babe' he glanced at me confused as if wondering 'did he just call you babe?'  

"I told you not to call me ba-"  

"Hey, man," Shane shook Evan's hand interrupting me.  

"Hey," Evan's voice was back to cold. It wasn't the same excited playful voice anymore.   

"So what were you guys doing?" Shane asked wrapping an arm around my shoulder, getting my side damp in a matter of seconds. I tried to push him off but he simply held me tightly against him. I gazed at Evan. His expression was unreadable but he was clenching his fists at his sides.   

"Take your hands off her," Evan hissed through clenched teeth, surprising me.   

"Excuse me?" Shane played the fool.  

"I said," Evan's biceps were tensed, I swear I could see his veins bulging out of his skin "Take your hands off her," he repeated deliberately slow.    

"And if I don't?" Shane challenged. Evan's pressed his lips in a tight line "You're going to make me?" Shane pulled me tighter against him. I struggled to get loose.   

"Let her go," Evan demanded dangerously.   

"Or what, freak?", Shane said, snarling.   

"Shane!" I protested not liking where this was going.   

"Don't provoke me," Evan menaced, anger plastered on his face.  

"I'm not afraid of you," Shane shrugged.  

"You should be,"  

"Oh yeah?" Shane's voice was getting serious "You lost your turn, loser, she's mine now,"  

"What?" I looked at Shane shocked.  

And then everything happened so fast my brain barely had time to register everything. Evan launched towards Shane, pushing him backwards getting me out of the way. Then, his fist connected with Shane's face hard. I was too shock to move, I was paralyzed. Shane fell to the ground, his nose was bleeding.   Oh my God!   Evan got on top of him and straddled him. I held my chest scared. Violence had always scared the hell out of me. Evan started punching Shane over and over again. the sound each punch produced was making me sick.   

"No!" I yelled shaking. I knew I had to do something. "Evan! Stop! No!" I came closer to them and was horrified to see the mess Shane's face was turning into. He was barely conscious "No, Evan! Don't!" I knelt next to them. Evan seemed lost in his own rage "Stop! Please!" I begged. I held his fist in the air catching his attention. Evan looked at me. His expression went from anger, to realization and finally regret. His knuckles were stained with blood: Shane's blood. Evan didn't seem to know what to say.  

"Oh God!" I exclaimed, letting go of his hand. He got off Shane so I leaned forwards my injured friend "Shane? Can you hear me?" I hadn't noticed the tears rolling down my face.   

"Ow!" was all Shane managed to utter as I helped him sit up.   

"Oh God! Are you okay?" I tried to clean his face with shaky hands.  

"Never been better," Shane's sarcastic remark was prove he was okay. He got on his feet, holding his nose.   

"Shane?" I was so worried. He ignored me and stared at Evan.  

"This isn't over," he promised as he started walking away. He was probably going to clean his face off in the river.

What the hell just happened?   I turned to face Evan.  

"What the fuck is wrong with you?!" I screamed at him angrily. Evan kept his gaze on the ground. I pushed his chest "You could have killed him!"   

"He started it," Evan looked up at me, his voice cold and unnerving.  

"He was joking! He's Shane! He's always joking!" I explained exasperated.   

"He wasn't joking!" Evan's tone rose "Can't you see the way he looks at you?"  

"What the hell are you talking about? Apologize to him!" I ordered.  

"No, he got what he deserved!"  

"What is your problem?!"  

"He is a jerk and you know it!"  

"So what? that doesn't give you the right to beat the crap out of him! That's just wrong!"  

"What about the things he does? they are not wrong?" I frowned in confusion "you know exactly what he did to Melissa. Is that what you want for yourself?"  

"So this is about Melissa?", I asked hurt.  

"No, this is about you. I won't let him play with you,"  

"He's not going to play with me! He's my friend!"  

"He wants you!" Evan hissed "It's obvious, you're just to naive to notice,"  

"He doesn't..." I trailed off taking in his words, "and what if he does want me? Why do you care? As far as I know, you only want to be my friend,"  

"I'm your friend. That's why I get to worry about you, that guy will only hurt you,"  

"He won't. He's not like you," The words left my mouth before I could stop them. Evan's face contorted in hurt "I'm sorry... I didn't mean... I..."  

"It's fine. You're right," my chest tightened.  

"I really didn't mean to say that," I looked for his eyes but he kept them everywhere but me. He turned around and held his head.   

"You should go back to your friends,"  

"No," this wasn't over. Not like this.  

"Jules, just go," he turned to me. We locked gazes; my chest was rising and falling due to my heavy breathing. We were both angry but there was something else flowing around us: Tension. I felt like there was an electric pull between us. All I wanted to do was close that space and kiss him with everything I had. Somehow I knew he wanted the same.   

And there we stood, staring into each other's eyes, holding ourselves back. Evan took one step closer; I swallowed feeling my dry throat.  

"You have to go before I do something stupid," his voice was a soft whisper now.   

"No," I took one step forwards.  

"Jules..." a shiver traveled down my spine. My name sounded so good in that sexy voice of his. He took three long strides towards me, until we were mere inches from each other. He held my face with both hands and rested his forehead on mine. His ragged breath fanned my lips teasingly. God, I'd never wanted something so bad as I wanted him to kiss me.  

"I won't let him have you,"  

"Why?" I looked right into his dark eyes.   

"Because you're mine"

And watch the video to the side, it's lovely. The song fits Evan -->&gt; Enjoy! Arix! My Wattpad Love Chapter 29 To say I was speechless was the biggest understatement of my life. I was dumbfounded, shocked, wordless and many other adjectives that represent bewilderment and
                                            surprise. I wasn't even sure I was still breathing. Evan's face remained so close to mine, our breaths were mixing together. I just needed to move one inch closer and I would be kissing him. Because you're mine...
                                            God, those words had sent shivers through my entire body. My breath had become unsteady; my heart was racing unhealthily inside my chest. Evan pressed his forehead against mine while his warm thumbs were caressing
                                            my cheeks gently. I wanted to kiss him so bad, it was killing me. Our noses touched, our lips were merely an inch apart. My lips parted yearning to feel his. My eyes looked for his, they looked darker than usual.
                                            I stared into them wondering, Why aren't you kissing me? The answer was obvious and it hit me like a bucket of cold water. He wasn't going to kiss me. He wanted me to do it so he could be free of blame for misleading
                                            me again. He wanted me to cross that line of friendship he had drawn between us. Line he had definitely pierced with his entire 'You're mine' statement because last time I checked, friends don't own each other.
                                            So where was he going with this? Understanding Evan could be extremely hard and exhausting. He couldn't just pretend to be my friend and then get me to kiss him. Somehow, he knew I wouldn't be able to resist
                                            him. He knew I was crazy about him and that put me in disadvantage. No matter how bad I wanted to kiss him -because I was honestly dying to- I knew I couldn't. I'd kissed him twice in my life and he ended up
                                            running after leaving me heartbroken. So yeah, I was crazy about the guy but I wasn't stupid or a masochist. It's like Albert Einstein said: "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting
                                            different results" I couldn't keep doing the same thing and expect a different outcome. Things needed to change for good. However, having him so close to me was incredibly tempting. The warmth coming from his
                                            body was dragging me to him. My love intoxicated heart was yelling at me to kiss him, to hug him but my mind thought otherwise. Listening to my heart hadn't actually earned me good results thereby it was time
                                            to listen to my brain. Ignoring my body's protests, I placed my hands on Evan's chest and using all my self-control, I pushed him backwards. I instantly felt cold without his touch. I lifted my gaze to look
                                            at him. He seemed surprise but he quickly covered it up with a cold expression. "I'm not yours," I forced the words out of my mouth. The whole sentence was a blatant lie because deep down, I was already his
                                            even when he hadn't even asked me out. Evan watched me in silence for a few seconds. I swallowed, trying to keep my strong pose. His shoulders relaxed as he shove his hands inside his pockets. "You're right,"
                                            he stated nonchalantly "I'm sorry," so he wasn't going to fight for me anymore, was he? I folded my arms across my chest. "Don't apologize to me, apologize to Shane," his expression hardened. "No," "Yes," "That's
                                            not gonna happen, Jules," There goes a shiver... Why was it that I always got that goose bumps whenever he said my name? Because you're possibly falling in love with him! My bold inner voice snapped at me. I
                                            mentally rolled my eyes before getting back to the situation at hand. "You need to apologize, it wasn't right to beat the crap out of Shane like that," "I can't apologize," "Then, I guess we are done here,"
                                            I said with all the coldness I could muster "Thanks for the necklace," I gave him a close mouth smile and turned on my feet. I started walking away, I could feel my heartbeats in my ears and throat. One Two
                                            Three... steps. Wasn't he going to stop me? Four... Five... My plan sucks. Six Seven I should stop counting my steps. Eight Nine Albert Einstein had definitely not met Evan when he said that stuff about doing
                                            things differently cause it wasn't really working for me. Ten I should've have kissed him. Eleven At least I would be walking away with the memory of his lips against mine instead of feeling genuinely stupid.
                                            Twelve Seriously, I need to stop counting. He's not gonna stop me. Thirteen. I blame it on all those romantic movies where the guy always stops the girl. Fourteen. Fif- "Jules, wait!" Did I hear him right? "Hey,
                                            wait!" he grabbed my arm turning me to him. I faced him trying to hide the relief within me. Play it cool, Jules. "What?" I asked, lifting my chin proudly. "I will do it," he said defeated. "You will do...?"
                                            I played the fool. Evan narrowed his eyes at me. "I will apologize to him," "That means you know what you did was wrong, right?" Evan gave me a flat look. "I'm trying here, okay?" he stated annoyed. "Fine,"
                                            I gave him a toothy grin, savoring my partial victory. Thank you, Albert Einstein. "Are we cool?" he wondered, watching me carefully. "Yeah," I nodded. "Good," his lips formed a lop-sided smirk. One of his dimples
                                            formed on his right cheek almost breaking my determination. "Good," I unfolded my arms, letting them fall at my sides. Evan's smile turned into a full smirk. "You look cute when you're angry," he pinched my
                                            nose. I chuckled. "You're a bipolar jerk, you know that, don't you?" I stated frankly. He shrugged "Maybe," "Maybe?" I cocked an eyebrow. He nodded. "Yeah," he ran his fingers through his midnight black hair,
                                            rolling his lower lip into his mouth "Would you give this bipolar jerk a hug?" he pouted. "A hug?" I was taken aback by his request. "Uhum," he gave me a puppy look "that way, I can know if I am truly forgiven,"
                                            he extended his arms towards me. I wavered. God, he looked so adorable but I didn't know if I could resist to having him so close to me again. "Apologize to Shane and I will give you all the hugs you want,"
                                            I traded avoiding the hug because right now, I couldn't have him close to me again. I had to wait for my self-control to reload. Evan shook his head disappointed. "You're mean," "I'm being fair so let's go,
                                            impulsive boxer, apologizing time," I gestured him to the way back to the bridge "And to pay for all the trouble you caused, you're giving me a piggyback," Ok, maybe I was taking advantage of the situation but
                                            hey, it wasn't everyday Evan was this submissive. He grinned at me. "Deal," he said giving his back to me, bending forwards slightly "Get on, mistress," I glared at the back of his head. Slowly, I approached
                                            him and crawled on his back, wrapping my arms around his neck and my legs around his waist. Evan held me up as if I weighted nothing. Jeez, I forgot how tall he was. When he lifted me, the ground looked far
                                            away. If I fell, it would be very painful "I won't let you fall," he assured probably sensing my fear. My almost naked torso was pressed against his back and even though he was fully dress, I could feel the
                                            heated skin beneath his t-shirt. He smelled so good, I struggled not to sniff on his hair and neck. "Go!" I encouraged him to move. Evan laughed softly before starting to walk towards the decorated bridge. In
                                            this position, I could take a better look at his tattoo. I studied the perfect curvy dark lines on his skin. It looked so professional. I felt like it had some tribal meaning. "Why so quiet?" Evan asked glancing
                                            at me over his shoulder "Are you having a panic attack?" "No, I just..." I knew the tattoo was a sensitive subject for him so I pushed away the questions about it "I'm admiring the sight," I lied burying my
                                            face in his hair, sniffing a little. I couldn't help it. It was so soft. "Are you sniffing on my hair?" "What? Pssst! Of course not!" I replied exaggeratedly. "Right," he mumbled as we crossed the bridge. The
                                            sun was nowhere to be found. Clouds were masking the once bright blue sky. Was it going to rain? Seriously? The day had started so good for the festival. Anyway, I scanned the crowd looking for my friends. I
                                            spotted Laura sitting on rock inside the river. Jordan was swimming around her. Where was Shane? As if in reply, Shane emerged from the water taking a deep breath in. Every girl in a 10 meters radio was gawking
                                            at him as he ran both of his hands through his hair, water droplets were rolling down his muscled chest, six-pack, and finally got lost down the defined V in his lower abdomen. As for his face, it didn't look
                                            so bad now that he had no trace of blood on it. However, his nose looked red-swollen and a bruise was starting to form around his left eye. This was the second time, I'd seen Shane beaten up. The first time
                                            was in that party at Jordan's place. That seemed so long ago. "There they are!" I pointed my friends out to Evan. He simply strode towards the direction I pointed. He dropped me gently when we reached the river
                                            bank "Hey! Guys!" I called them out waving my hand at them to get their attention. Lau was the first one to spot me. "Hey!" she waved her hand back at me and then her eyes landed on Evan. She grinned knowingly
                                            "Hey, Evan!" "Hi," Evan whispered shyly. Shane noticed the commotion and looked at us. He glared openly at Evan. I felt Evan stiffened next to me. Ugh, this is awkward. "Shane!" I shouted his name, getting his
                                            attention "Can you come here for a sec, please?" I watched him hesitate for a second before swimming his way over to us. Dripping wet, he got out of the river and stood in front of us. As soon as I got both
                                            of them to face each other, I knew this was a bad a idea. Shane was shooting daggers at Evan, he was obviously still pissed at him. Alright, I need to solve this maturely. "Shane, Evan has something to say,"
                                            I stated awkwardly. Shane cocked his head waiting. Evan remained in silence "Evan?" I reminded him. "I'm sorry, dude," Evan said expressionless. I gestured him to continue "I'm sorry for beating you up," Shane
                                            scoffed. "You didn't beat me up. You punched like a girl," "Shane," I warned him getting between them. "Oh really?" Evan inquired arrogantly. "Ok, ok, that's enough," I stated nervously. It was hard to breath
                                            through the tension between those two. I looked for Lau around the river for help. We exchanged gazes and she understood I needed her. I think that is one of the greatest thing of having a best friend, you can
                                            speak to them with just a simple look. "Hey, guys!" Lau exclaimed getting out of the river "Why don't we go for a swim?" she wrapped her arm around Shane's arm "Come on, Shane," she pulled at him. Shane didn't
                                            budge for a second, glaring at Evan but then he gave up and let Lau dragged him back to the river. I let out a sigh of relief. "He's a jerk," Evan muttered. I glanced at him. "Yeah but he's not a bad guy," I
                                            said watching Lau and Shane diving in the water. "How can you say that?" Evan wondered. I could feel his eyes on me. "I don't know... he can be..." I trailed off remembering all those times Shane'd been there
                                            for me. Remembering that time, he failed math because of me. The memories brought a smile to my lips "He's just... Shane," I shrugged. "Do you like him?" Evan asked, his voice was restrained. I snapped my head
                                            towards him taken aback by his question. I frowned. "That's none of your business," I stated averting my gaze. Shane was attractive but I'd never thought of him in a romantic way. We were too different for that.
                                            Shane was my friend, that was all.nevertheless, I wasn't going to tell Evan that. I wanted him curious about the entire Shane's subject. "I thought we were friends," Evan murmured. "We are," "Then why can't
                                            you tell me if you like him?" he pressed. "Why do you care?" I looked at him defiantly. He shrugged. "I'm curious, that's all," he shove his hands inside his pockets "I just hope you're smart enough not to fall
                                            for his looks," "I'm good, you don't need to worry about me," "I can see that," there was a glint of need in his dark eyes. A thunder made me jump slightly. then, it began to drizzle. Cold raindrops started
                                            touching my bare torso, making me shiver. Everyone with dry clothes around rushed to the parking lot to their cars. Lau emerged from the water. Her eyes widened when she noticed the rain. "Jules!" She cried
                                            out "Our phones! Please, take them to the car before they get wet!" she pointed their clothes. They were lying on a rock. "Ok!" I picked up her shorts, Jordan's and Shane's t-shirts. I wrapped the clothes around
                                            the phones to protect them. I looked up to the rocky way to the parking lot. Ok, that was not going to be easy. "You need help?" Evan asked knowingly. I glanced at him, he was smiling at me. "No," I replied
                                            secure. I can do this. If I manage to resist kissing Evan a few minutes ago, I could definitely do this. Believe it or not, I did it. I managed to run through the rocks without falling. The drizzle was turning
                                            slowly into heavy rain. Evan was following right behind me, as if he was waiting to catch me if I fell. We reached the parking lot's entrance when a familiar voice screamed my name loudly. I looked behind me
                                            to see... "Jason?" I knew he would come to the festival but I hadn't seen him around. "I... need... to... talk... to you..." he said panting. "This is not the best time, I have-" "I can take the phones to my
                                            car if you want," Evan offered noticing the despair on my best friend's face. "Okay," I gave him the clothes and phones. "I'll wait for you in the car, it's right there," Evan pointed his black car before walking
                                            off. It was already raining heavily when I looked at Jason. "This better be good," I warned because I was getting damp as I said that. Jason was resting his hand on his knees, trying to recover his breath. He
                                            looked up at me. "Helen..." he sounded breathless "we're kind of back together," "That's good but I don't know if you notice but it's pouring with rain! You could've waited to tell me that!" Jason straightened
                                            his body. He was shirtless. "I know, the thing is she's been acting weird and I..." I couldn't hear the rest. The rain was so heavy, it was getting hard to see/hear through it. "What?" I shouted. "I said..."
                                            "I can't hear you!" I screamed frustrated. Raindrops were getting in my mouth whenever I spoke, I spit them out cleaning off my face. Jason stepped closer. "I said I..." "What?!" "She... know... I... how..."
                                            all I got were fractions of word that made no sense. Jason must've seen the confusion on my face because he wrapped an arm around my waist, pulling me to him and leaned into my ear "I said I think she likes
                                            me," his warm breath gave me goosebumps. It was freezing out here. "We already knew that," I said annoyed. Jason's body was pressed against mine keeping me warm. Anyone could have thought we were a couple, making
                                            out under the rain. "No, you don't understand," Jason spoke softly in my ear "I mean, she really likes me," "I don't get it," he sighed frustrated, his blow of air tickled my neck. I giggled. "It's not funny,
                                            Jules," "I know, I wasn't-never mind. What's the problem?" "I think she wants us to be official... you know, to have a relation-ship and all that crap," I grinned. "And?" "I don't know what to do," "Cause I'll
                                            never be with you," I sang quoting James Blunt's song 'You're beautiful' Jason pinched my waist. "I'm being serious here," "Fine, Mr. Seriousness, what did she say?" "She asked me if I wanted to take our thing
                                            to the next level," "And what did you say?" "That I needed to pee," I rolled my eyes, laughing loudly but Jason remained quiet. "Wait... Are you serious?" I asked in disbelief. "I freak out, okay? She's waiting
                                            for me as we speak, you better tell me what to do," "I can't do that. It's your choice to make," I ruffled his wet hair "It's simple, what do you want to do?" "I don't know," "Then tell her you need time to
                                            think about it," "I can't leave her hanging like that. You should have seen her face, she was so scared of my reaction," "Poor her! I wish I could tell you what to do but It's your choice, Jason," "I know..."
                                            he sighed making me giggle again "I just don't want complications," "Do you like her?" "Yeah," "But it's only a physical thing or there is more?" "I don't know," "I don't know," I mimicked his words, holding
                                            his face to look at him "You, my friend, need to make up your mind," He smiled sadly at me. "My head is a mess," "You're gonna be fine," I assured caressing his face. "You really think so?" He looked so hopeless,
                                            so vulnerable. I pulled him into a tight hug. "Yeah, you're a good boy," I was nothing but frank. We both pulled away "Just hold her close, look into her eyes and then you'll know exactly what to do," I gave
                                            him the wisest piece of advice I could think of. "Now, go back to her, she's probably thinking she scared you away," "Thank you," he gave me a genuine smile which I quickly returned. "Go!" I shooed him, pushing
                                            his chest facetiously. He grinned, turned on his feet and left. I was glad he finally left, mostly because I was freezing my butt out here. Rubbing my arms, I scanned the almost empty parking lot to find Evan's
                                            car. When I spotted it, I rushed towards it. Evan was inside looking warm and cozy while I was shaking uncontrollably outside the passengers door. He pushed the door opened for me. "Get in!" he ordered loudly.
                                            "But I'm dripping wet! I'll ruin your seat!" Evan rolled his eyes. "Just get in before you freeze to death!" "No," "Jules," he warned "I'll drag you inside if it's necessary," his tone was mandatory. I was sure
                                            my lips were turning purple. Reluctantly, I got inside the car. The warmth welcomed me calming my trembling hands and quivering lips. I rubbed my hands together. It smelled really good in here, it smelled like...
                                            Evan. I knew he was staring at me, I could feel it "Take this," he offered me a blanket. "Thanks," I grasped it, covering my frozen body. Silence reigned between us and it suddenly became hard to breath. I could
                                            feel the tension forming in the air. We're alone in his car... and it's raining. Blood rushed to my cheeks as I remembered that passionate kiss we shared under the rain last week. Don't think about it, Jules!
                                            "Is Jason okay?" Evan's sexy voice broke the silence. "Yeah," I nodded averting my gaze. "Jules," his voice was soft "look at me," nervously; I turned my head to him. We locked gazes and my heart skipped a beat.
                                            God, he was so cute. Inevitably, my gaze dropped to his lips. Evan extended his hand towards me; he cupped my cheek... my skin heated at his warm palm. I swallowed; everything about him was dragging me closer:
                                            his smell, his looks, his voice, his thoughts, his poems... just everything. His eyes held so many emotions. "Evan... I..." he pressed his index on my lips silencing me. "I'm sorry, Jules. I'm truly sorry for
                                            hurting you," he whispered sincerely " I know I can be confusing. I don't want you thinking this is a game for me. I never meant to play with you... I swear," I was shocked by his words "I just..." he leaned
                                            closer "I know I'm not being fair to you... I'm being a selfish bastard because I can't let you go even though that's the right thing to do," "Evan, I-" "I'm not as strong as I thought I was," he cut me off
                                            gripping my face tightly "you're gonna have to be strong and stay away from me since I can't find the strength to get away from you," he closed his eyes, our foreheads colliding together. The rain had stopped
                                            outside the car. I could only hear our heavy breaths mixing since we were so close. "But I-" "You need to get out of the car now, Jules," he said softly. "Why?" "I won't be able to hold myself back for much
                                            longer," "What do you mean?" "I want to kiss you so bad. I'm dying to taste those sweet lips of yours again. My hands are itching to touch you, to feel you," his words heated my body "So get away from me while
                                            you can," How could I tell him I wanted the same thing? I opened my mouth to speak... "Jules!" Jordan's voice made us both jump away from each other. It was like we were in sort of trance and we snapped out
                                            of it. Jordan was knocking on my window. I opened it. "What?" I spat angrily. "We have a problem, come out," he informed looking worried. I stepped out of the car worried. Did something happen to Laura? "What's
                                            wrong? Where's Lau and Shane?" "Shane left with some redhead and Lau is buying some souvenirs in the last booth," Jordan's words calmed me "Well, the rain was pretty heavy," "I know," I gave him a duh look.
                                            Evan joined us interested in the conversation. He probably noticed Jordan's worried expression. "Hey," Evan shook Jordan's hand. "What's up, man?" Jordan smiled. "What's wrong?" Evan asked straight-forwardly.
                                            "Apparently, the rain was pretty intense and there was a collapse on the road. There's mood and a huge tree blocking the way back home," I opened my mouth surprise. "Oh God!" I held my forehead "What are we
                                            going to do? they're going to clean the road, I suppose, right?" "Yeah but since it's nearly the evening, the road won't be ready until tomorrow," I blew a strand of wet hair out of my face. "Great! Just great!"
                                            I exclaimed sarcastically. Lau strode towards us holding some bags. She didn't seem concerned about the entire road situation. "Hey again," she greeted Evan. He simply smiled at her "So did you find a solution,
                                            babe?" Jordan shook his head "we can always stay in a hotel," she offered shrugging. "Already called, they're full because of this entire festival event," Jordan retorted defeated. I rubbed my face with both
                                            hands, thinking 'Mom is going to kill me'. "Well, we could sleep in the car," Lau added trying to calm us down. "And freeze to death?" I chimed in annoyed "Look at us, we're all damp and as far as i know, we
                                            didn't bring any more clothes," "Hey, don't get mad at me," she raised her hands in a peaceful sign "this is not my fault," "I'm sorry," I apologized "I'm cold and hungry, sorry for snapping at you," Lau pinched
                                            my cheek. "It's cool, our situation sucks," "Yeah, it does," "You could all stay over my place," the three of us snapped our heads towards Evan. "Really?" Lau's face brightened up. I couldn't bring myself to
                                            say something. "You sure, man?" Jordan asked cautiously. "Yeah, my house is awfully big," Evan shrugged. "Are you sure, man?" Jordan repeated his question "We don't want to intrude," "It's cool, really, you
                                            can spend the night there and come back home when the road is ready tomorrow," Lau squealed excitedly and gave him a quick hug. "Thank you," she grinned widely at him "That's really nice of you," "No problem,"
                                            Evan glanced at me, probably expecting me to say something but I was mute "I'll start the engine, you can follow me with your car, man," he said to Jordan "My house is not really far from here," "Okay," Jordan
                                            agreed walking to his car. Lau and I exchanged gazes. "Go with him," Lau gestured me to Evan. "No," "Come on, Jules," "He said we should follow him, I'm going with you guys," I stated stubbornly. "Please, he's
                                            being really nice by letting us stay over his house. Keep him company," "Lau!" "Go!" she pushed me towards his car. Growling in frustration, I walked with long strides to Evan's car. He was already opening the
                                            driver's door. He spotted me and smiled at me. "You're coming with me?" he was amused. "If you want to," I folded my arms across my chest "if you don't I can-" "Don't be silly, get in," he jumped in the driver's
                                            seat. I remained still in front of the passenger's seat, Evan opened the door from the inside, pushing it opened for me "What are you waiting for?" he asked leaning over my seat. I was nervous about being alone
                                            again with him in his car after what happened a few minutes ago. Evan smirked up at me "Get in, I don't bite," he teased "At least, not hard," he winked at me. My stomach did a major black flip. Swallowing my
                                            nervousness, I got inside the car. It was going to be a long night... X M W L X A/N: Heya! I hope you enjoyed the chapter! Thanks for the support, guys! Next chapter will be fun muahaha Join the facebook group!

                                            I heard Laura say as we all stood in front of Evan's house. I couldn't agree more with her. We were facing a big two story house with dark blue walls, white Victorian windows and a big front garden. "Come on,"
                                            Evan said walking past us. I stared at his back, swallowing hard. I couldn't believe I was about to go in his house. I mean, he was the guy I met on Wattpad. I never expected him to live thirty minutes away
                                            from my town, or to have these immense feelings towards him. When we were in the car, the tension had been absolutely unbearable. It was a good thing he lived ten minutes away from the river, otherwise I wasn't
                                            sure I could have survived. "Jules?" Lau waved her hand in front of my face "come on, move. It's freezing out here." she gave me a little push. We followed Evan through a path with small trees and flowers at
                                            both sides. I was embracing myself, rubbing up my arms with my hands. It was already getting dark, and Lau was right, it was pretty cold here. Evan opened his front door and held it opened for us. I was the
                                            last one to cross the door. He stared at me intensely as I passed him. We stepped inside the hall, and immediately I felt the warmth receiving my cold body. I wondered if this was his parents' house, but I knew
                                            I couldn't ask him that, at least not in front of Lau and Jordan. Evan led us towards the living room. There were three huge brown couches, two lamps, wooden framed paintings and a small fireplace. A curved
                                            wood-made staircase was placed to our left. The entire place shouted warmth and comfort. "Nice place, man," Jordan complimented checking our surroundings. "Thanks," Evan mumbled shyly. We all stood there not
                                            knowing what to do. Awkward much? But of course, I had to be the one to break the uncomfortable silence. How? Sneezing. "Oh, you're probably all freezing," Evan realized, noticing our wet outfits "There's a
                                            bathroom down the hall," he pointed to our right. "Jordan will take that one," Lau said pushing her boyfriend. "No, babe, you go first," Jordan stated like a gentleman. "You go, I'm sure there's another bathroom
                                            here, right Evan?" Lau smiled at Evan. What was she planning? I squinted at her. "Yeah, there's actually two more upstairs," Evan replied hesitantly "One is in the hall and the other one is my room," Lau grinned
                                            like a Cheshire cat. "I'll take the one in the hall if you don't mind," Evan opened his mouth to say something "Thanks," she glanced at me with a smirk "You can use his bathroom, Jules." she winked at me and
                                            ran upstairs leaving us alone. I was so embarrassed. Lau made choices as if this was her house. "I'm sorry, she's a bit... bold sometimes," I apologized, gazing at the wooden floor "I can wait for her or Jordan
                                            to finish... you don't have to let me use your bathroom, I-" Evan's warm fingers held my chin, forcing me to look up at him. Our eyes met making my heart beat quicker. "It's cool," he said in a relaxed tone
                                            "come on, or you'll get sick." He held my hand, leading me upstairs. The dragons in my stomach were now soaring as I struggled not to squeal like a little girl right there. He's holding my hand! When we finished
                                            climbing the stairs, we found ourselves in a long hallway. There were doors at each side. I could hear the water running somewhere and realized it was probably Lau taking a shower. Since when was she this bold,
                                            smarty girl? She seemed to have everything planned to get me alone with Evan in his room. That evil genius! Hanging out with Shane and Jordan was definitely making her more avid and malicious. I was so deep
                                            in thought that when Evan stopped, I slammed into his back. "Sorry!" I exclaimed ashamed. He didn't say anything, but instead pushed a door open. He gestured me to go in first, but I hesitated. "What?" He asked
                                            with a little smirk, "Little Jules is afraid of going inside the Shark's cave?" "No," I replied with a flustered face, heat niggling at my cheeks. His words reminded me of the poem he wrote to me. Evan stared
                                            at me, making my breathing hitch. I looked away, and entered his room. I couldn't see a thing until he turned on the lights. My jaw dropped to the floor. I can honestly say I'd never seen so much black together
                                            in my entire life. Everything was black: the walls, the bed's sheets, the window's curtains, the mirror's frame, even the floor was carpeted black. It made the room feel so small and swallowing. "Wow, that's
                                            a lot of black," I commented, my eyes still roaming around his cave "you took the dark poet thing to a huge new level, huh?" I joked looking back at him. Evan was leaning against the door frame, his arms crossed
                                            over his chest. Somehow knowing he was blocking my only way out was making me nervous. I was in his territory, I was vulnerable. I waited for him to say something but he remained in silence. His heavy gaze was
                                            making me uneasy. "Hum," I started awkwardly "where's the bathroom?" Evan aimed his finger to a black door next to the drawers. I was about to move towards it when he stepped inside the room, closing the door
                                            behind him. We're alone in his room... He just closed the door. I'm going to die of a heart attack. I watched him walk past me and looked for something inside the drawers. "You can use this towel," he handed
                                            me a dark blue towel. I grasped it with a shaking hand. "Thanks," I pressed the towel against my chest and ran off into the bathroom. I locked the door behind me and let out a long breath. Phew! I could finally
                                            feel my heart getting back to his regular beating. They say love is good for your health... Good my ass! I was lucky to be young, otherwise I would have had a heart failure a long time ago. I stripped from my
                                            damp clothes and jumped inside the shower. It was a well-sized bathroom, nothing too big or too small. And guess what color the pottery was? Yep, you guessed right: Black. Warm water started falling on me, relaxing
                                            me. Ah! That felt good. I grasped the soap and for a moment, I simply gazed at it. Evan had used this soap... He had rubbed it all over his hot body. The thought made me shiver in delight. Oh God, I need help.
                                            Shaking my head at myself, I proceeded to continue with my relaxing shower. When I was done, I grabbed the towel and wrapped it around me. It was then my not so bright brain seemed to remember I didn't bring
                                            any dry clothes. I clutched my forehead with one hand and pressed the towel against me with the other. There was no way I was leaving the bathroom like this. I glanced at my damp clothes lying on the floor.
                                            No, I couldn't put them on again. I didn't want to get sick. Since I didn't want to leave the bathroom wrapped-up in toilet paper, which sounds like something Lady Gaga would do, I didn't have a choice but to
                                            hope for Evan to hear my precarious whispers. "Evan?" I hoped he was still in the room "Hey, Evan!" Nothing. Maybe he went downstairs. Arg! I unlocked the door and slowly pulled it open, sticking my head out.
                                            Evan had his back to me and was looking for something on his night table "Evan?" he turned to me and grinned. "Need help over there?" he asked suggestively. I glared at him, but couldn't help the blood rushing
                                            to my cheeks. "No, I just need some dry clothes." "I figured. I brought you some clothes," he pointed his bed "They're Helen's, she left them here when she visited me last week." "I don't think that's a good
                                            idea." "Why?" "Well, Helen and I..." Evan waited for me to continue "Never mind," I couldn't tell him his sister probably hated my guts. "I'll let you change," he stated, leaving the room. Believe it or not,
                                            the rest of the night was boring. Evan avoided being alone to be at all costs. We were all too tired to prepare something to eat so we got some chips and crackers before going to bed early. Lau and Jordan were
                                            -of course- sharing a room, therefore I was thrown into a lonely room. I was mad at Evan. Why was he avoiding me now? I tossed around my bed trying to get some sleep. After an hour of futile attempts, I finally
                                            fell in dreamland. ** I don't know what woke me up. I just had this weird feeling in my stomach. At first I thought it was hunger, but as I sat up I realized the feeling expanded to my chest, constricting it.
                                            Something was wrong. I sneaked a quick look at the alarm clock next to the bed: 1:27 am. God, what am I doing awake? I rubbed my face, swinging my legs out of the bed. I got up and went out of my room, stepping
                                            into the dark hallway. Half-sleep, I headed towards Evan's door. Carefully, I pulled it opened and stuck my head inside. (Play the song now!) He was there. He was awake. He was sitting on the edge of his bed,
                                            his naked back to me. He was slightly bending over, his elbows on his knees. His face was buried in both of his hands. He looked so lost, so vulnerable. I didn't know what to do so I stood there in his door
                                            frame motionless. His bed was a disaster as if he'd been tossing around repeatedly. His pale back stood out of the black sheets and walls. His dark hair was disheveled; each strand was pointing a different direction.
                                            It was obvious he couldn't sleep, but why? "Evan?" he tensed up at my voice. He glanced at me over his shoulder. "What are you doing here?" his tone was cold. I took a step inside. "I couldn't sleep," I lied.
                                            "Go back to bed," he ordered looking back ahead of him. "Are you okay?" I asked worriedly. Evan didn't say anything. I knew he wasn't okay. It led me to wonder why do we always ask a person, who's obviously
                                            not okay, if they are? It's a stupid unnecessary question. Grasping some courage, I slowly walked around his bed. I wanted to see his face. I was hoping his expression could help me figure out what was wrong
                                            with him. I stopped right in front of him, my figure was blocking the moonlight streaming through the window behind me. My shadow was fully coating him. He didn't look at me though, his gaze seemed lost as if
                                            he wasn't there with me. "Evan?" he looked up at me and my heart shrieked and sank in my chest. His eyes were filled with so much sadness and pain I felt my eyes water. He wasn't hiding the pain anymore, it
                                            was rolling off him freely. It was like he had taken the cold mask off and for the first time since I met him, I was finally seeing his hidden side, and now I knew why he hid it, because it was heartbreaking
                                            to watch him like this. There were bags under his penetrating dark eyes, my eyes roamed down his chest and it was then I noticed the scars. I clutched hold of my chest and struggled with not being surprised.
                                            There were many scars... on his chest and abdomen. I remembered Mom telling me about how he'd been victim of abuse for years. "They're repulsive, aren't they?" his voice brought my gaze back to his face. I frowned
                                            at him for a second, not understanding his words. But then it dawned on me, he was talking about his scars. I opened my mouth to say something but he cut me off "Don't answer that." "Evan, I-" "What?" he got
                                            up abruptly "You what, Jules?" there was anger lacing his voice. I stumbled backwards taken aback by his outburst. "I'm sorry," I mumbled. Evan stared down at me coldly. "Why are you apologizing?" he frowned.
                                            "I don't know, I just..." my eyes landed on his scars once again. God, there was a large one that started on his chest and crossed down his stomach. He gave me one last look before turning on his feet. He searched
                                            for a sweater inside his drawers and put it on angrily. He slammed the drawer closed, and stalked towards the door. He was leaving? "Where are you going?" I asked following him. He turned to me. "Stay here,"
                                            he hissed through clenched teeth "I need some fresh air." I watched him walk down the hall and disappear down the stairs. Hell no! I wasn't going to let him go out like this. I ran after him, my bare feet moving
                                            across the cold floor and stairs. When I reached the living room I frowned, he wasn't around. The front door looked intact, locked and unused. Where did he go? As if on cue, I heard a door being closed. I followed
                                            the noise, it was coming from the kitchen. I crossed the dark kitchen and opened the back door. The cold night breeze met my skin. I shivered. The full moon was lighting up the entire place as if it was daylight
                                            already. There he was... Evan was walking fast through his backyard. I chased after him. Rocks and stiff grass were pinching my bare feet, I winced but kept going. "Evan!" I yelled at him, trying to catch up
                                            with him. He didn't stop, but quickened his pace instead "Wait!" I grabbed his arm but he slapped my hand away "Evan!" I was already out of breath, catching up with him was a lot of harder than I thought "Evan!
                                            Stop!" I grabbed his arm again, this time he whipped around fast to face me. "What?" he snapped rudely. "Where are you going?" I was breathless. "That's none of your business, go back to the house," he ordered,
                                            clenching his fists as if containing his anger. "No," I shook my head "No until you tell me what's wrong." "Go back to the house," he repeated each word deliberately slow. "Talk to me," I pleaded. I didn't bother
                                            to hide the despair in my voice. We locked gazes and I watched him hesitate for a slight second. "There's nothing to talk about," his voice was pure bitterness. "Why can't you just tell what's wrong? I can help
                                            you, I-" "Help me?" he let out a fake cynical laugh "I don't need your help, I'm fine." "Stop lying, Evan. Whatever is bothering you, you don't have to face it alone, I'm here," I tried to reach for him but
                                            he stepped backwards. I ignored the pain his rejection caused inside of me "I know you had a hard past, I know-" "You know?" he asked skeptically "You know nothing, Jules. You've lived happily in that dreamy
                                            bubble of yours! You've had everything!" his tone rose "You've had a good perfect life, so don't come to me with that crap!" he was yelling now. "My life is far from perfect!" I found myself yelling as well
                                            "We all have our own problems, don't you dare say I had a perfect life because that's not true." he rubbed a palm over his face roughly. "Listen, I just need to be alone, okay?" he whispered obviously struggling
                                            to keep his calm. "No," I said stubbornly "You need to vent your feelings out, Evan." I was desperate. It was killing to see him like this, so broken. He was hurting, I knew he was. "I'm fine." "No, you're not."
                                            "I'm fine!" he clenched his fists at his sides, his knuckles turning white. "You are not fine. Stop lying, stop pretending." I'm here for you... "I don't wanna talk about it," he let out a long breath. "Why
                                            are you mad at me?" I had to ask, he was still clenching his fists. He was angry. "This isn't about you." he shook his head. He stared at me in silence for a few seconds. I stared back, expecting him to yell
                                            at me again. He sighed, relaxing his shoulders, "Come with me," he held my hand. I looked at him surprised as he pulled me behind him. We walked around some pine trees until we came to face a lake. There was
                                            a small boat dock there. The sight was beautiful. The full moon was reflected on the calmed dark water. I could see the shape of mountains far away from us. He led me through the dock until we reached the edge
                                            of it. He sat down, his feet dangling in the air. I sat next to him, admiring the view. I stole a few glances at him unable to help it, moonlight was brushing past his creamy skin. He looked so handsome it made
                                            my heart ache. "It's beautiful," I said breaking the silence. Did he bring me here to distract me? Was this his way to change the subject? "This is where I come when I can't sleep," he said in a soft whisper.
                                            I glanced at him but he was staring up at the sky, submerged in his own thoughts. I looked back at the lake. "It's so calm," I could still feel the tension between us, but he seemed collected than before. The
                                            water was moving slowly and peacefully, the night breeze brushing past us and blowing my hair from my face. It was cold out here, but I didn't care much about it. Silence reigned between us. It wasn't an uncomfortable
                                            one though, it was a peaceful one. It was like we were both calming ourselves down, enjoying the quietness of this place. "She was going to leave him," Evan said all of a sudden. I peered at him confused "My
                                            mother." He clarified before continuing "She was going to leave my dad, she had finally grasped the courage to do it after being abused for years," My eyes widened. Was he going opening up to me? "She told me
                                            about her intentions a week in advance. She wanted me to help her. She needed me to lie to Helen about the reason we were leaving since Helen had no idea of the things my Dad had done to us. I never let him
                                            touch one single hair on my little sister. I took all the blows for her, he had already fucked me up. I couldn't let him ruin her, too." his voice was pure agony, it was killing him to talk about this. I knew
                                            it, but I still wanted him to continue "Helen had a normal childhood, I made sure she had it. I lost count of how many times I lied to her about my bruises, my absence at school when I couldn't even stand."
                                            A pained expression crossed his face "Lying to her became so easy to me. That's why Mom asked me to deal with Helen. We had everything ready to leave him," he looked down, his eyebrows knitted together before
                                            speaking again, "The night before the day, we planned to leave. I woke up from a nightmare and went downstairs. My Dad was in the living room all by himself. He told me that he loved me, that we were everything
                                            to him. I was so stupid-" he cut off abruptly, his lips trembled but he pressed them together to keep talking "I believed him. I believed his words, I thought he had changed. I thought there was a slight chance
                                            we could be a family again." He paused to take a heaving breath, "I told him about Mom's plan of leaving him. I was so stupid," he shook his head, closing his eyes. My heart shrank in my chest. I grasped his
                                            shoulder trying to comfort him. "I'm sorry," my voice was low and sad. Evan opened his eyes again, they were crystallized with tears. His chest was rising and falling heavily. "He..." he trailed off, gripping
                                            the boat dock's edge tightly "He went crazy. He started hitting me over and over until I was on the ground writhing in pain. Mom heard the commotion and came running downstairs. It was then he pulled the gun
                                            out. Mom froze when she saw it. I tried to stand, but I only managed to get on a sitting position against the couch. I knew I had some broken ribs, but I didn't care. He was aiming the gun at Mom. I'd never
                                            felt so scared in my entire life," his knuckles were turning white as he tightened his grip on the dock's edge "Mom tried to persuade him to drop the gun down. I tried to get his attention back to me but it
                                            was useless. He grew angrier and angrier each passing second. Mom was begging him to stop, I was yelling at him. And then it happened," he took in a shaky breath "I will never forget that moment, there was a
                                            click when he pulled the trigger followed by a shot. Mom's body fell limp a few steps away from me. I tried to crawl to her but he got in my way. He knelt in front of me and pressed the gun against my temple.
                                            I thought he was going to kill me, I closed my eyes tightly not wanting to see anything. He forced me to open my eyes, 'Watch' he said as he aimed the gun to his right. I followed his arm. Helen was standing
                                            at the end of the stairs. I didn't get the chance to tell her to leave. He just shot her and she stumbled backwards before finally falling to the ground, he..." his voice was a mere whisper. My sight was blurred
                                            with tears, "He killed himself after that," he finished, closing his eyes. A tear rolled down my cheek freely "I'm-" my voice broke "I'm so sorry." "Don't be," he stated "it was all my fault. I shouldn't have
                                            told him anything." "It wasn't your fault," I wiped my tears away. "I should've kept my fucking my mouth shut. Mom is dead because of me, Helen almost died because of me. I was stupid!" he ran his fingers through
                                            his hair "How could I believe him?!" He jumped to his feet. I imitated him "Fuck!" he kicked the wooden dock upset. "Evan, it wasn't your fault, you-" "Stop saying that!" he yelled at me "She trusted me! She
                                            wanted me to help her and I betrayed her!" he fell to his knees, breathing heavily "She was going to leave him," he muttered sadly. I knelt in front of him feeling his pain. I could only imagine how much he'd
                                            suffered all these years blaming himself. I held his face with both my hands. Tears were streaming down my face. "You can't blame yourself for this," my voice was raspy. "She was going to leave him," he repeated
                                            with watered eyes. My heart was breaking for him "I miss her." "I know." "She was... amazing, she was so strong. She was always there for me..." he closed his eyes, his lips trembling "and when she needed me,
                                            I failed her." a single tear escaped his eye, falling on my thumb. I bit my lower lip, holding back a sob. I knew there was nothing I could say to make him feel better and that was killing me. The man in front
                                            of me was not the cold, strong man anymore. That faÃ§ade had fallen off. His pale face was contorted in pain as if he fought the tears back. He bowed his head, hiding his face from me. What could I say? I wasn't
                                            even sure I could speak without breaking into sobs. I held his face, forcing him to look up at me. His dark eyes were filled with grief, "Now you're giving me that look," he shook his head, smiling sadly. I
                                            dropped my hands to my sides confused "What look?" "That pity look, I hate it." "I'm sorry." I pressed my forehead against his. His hot breath fanned my lips. "I have issues, Jules, for real. You have no idea,"
                                            he whispered bringing his hands to my face "I'm seriously fucked up." his thumbs rubbed my wet cheeks softly. "You're not bad," it seemed so inappropriate to have this urge to kiss him now. "I'm not something
                                            you can fix," he affirmed, our noses touched. "I-" "No," he interrupted me, closing his eyes "You're too young, too innocent for this." "Evan," I swallowed. My chest was burning "I know I can't take the pain
                                            away, but I..." the words stuck in my throat. How did it happen? When? I had no idea, I just had to say those words before they burned my heart away "I love you," I whispered, tasting the salty tears in my mouth.
                                            Evan's body went stiff. I kept my eyes shut "I know I can't fix you. God, I don't even know what to say to make you feel better, but I love you and I will love every single shattered piece of you. I know I will,
                                            I-" he pressed his lips gently against mine, silencing me. The kiss was soft but filled with so much emotion I felt my heart tighten inside my chest, my toes curling. He kissed me slowly as if he wanted to savor
                                            me. He tasted sweet and tangy. I was in Heaven, I'd never felt so complete in my entire life. The world around us vanished. All my senses were focused on the sensation of his plump lips on mine. I knew he hadn't
                                            told me he loved me back but I didn't care. Everything I needed was right there, in his kiss. I tangled my fingers through his messy hair enjoying the softness of it. Reluctantly, Evan broke the kiss, his thumbs
                                            brushing my cheeks. We stared into each other's eyes in silence. Sometimes, words are redundant. We didn't need to say anything. I could see everything in his eyes. "I don't wanna hurt you," he said, honesty
                                            dripping from his tongue. "You won't." "How can you know that?" the dark pool of his eyes was filled with anxiety. "I trust you." I gave him a short kiss. "Why?" "I just do," he gave me a sad smile. "It's not
                                            going to be easy," he warned. I could see the fear in his expression. He was afraid I would leave him. "I know." "Stand up," he ordered getting to his feet. I stood up frowning at him "If we're going to do this,
                                            I'm gonna do it right," he got on one knee. "Oh God, no! no, no," I waved my hands in front of me in negation "you don't have to- " "Shut up!" he exclaimed disapprovingly "You're ruining the moment," a smile
                                            crept to my lips. He looked so cute kneeling in front of me "Jules?" "Yes?" I barely found my voice. He grinned up at me, sadness still lingering on his expression, but it was soon being replaced by excitement.
                                            "Would you do this passionate dark poet the honor of being his strawberry girlfriend?" I chuckled at his original way to ask me that. There was nothing conventional about us. I nodded my head, feeling warm and
                                            genuinely happy. Evan got on his feet and wrapped his arms around my waist. He placed a soft kiss on my cheek. "I guess that makes you Mr. Strawberry, huh?" I teased. He cocked an eyebrow. "As long as you let
                                            me kiss you, I guess I'm okay with it." I wrapped my arms around his neck. "And if I don't?" "I will steal kisses from you then," he shrugged. "Is that so? Well let me tell you something, I may look small but
                                            I'm- " he slammed his lips against mine. He gripped my face tightly, kissing me passionately. Our lips were moving together in sync. His long fingers tangled through my hair as he deepened the kiss. I shivered
                                            as waves of electricity and heat embraced me from head to toe. He pulled me closer. I felt his tongue slowly invade its way into my mouth. This kiss was different from the one before. It was wild, rough and
                                            passionate; we were hungry for each other. We were both now breathing heavily as he sucked on my lower lip, stealing a soft sigh from me. I loved him. I wanted him. All I wanted, all I needed was him and it
                                            was always going to be that way no matter what. X M W L X Nothing to say... Remember to nominate this story for the Special Awards. Best Overall cast award :) Love Arix *******************************************

                                            "Stop it!" I screamed out of breath, tears of laughter were rolling down the sides of my face. "Say it!" Evan ordered tickling my sides mercilessly. Playful evilness plastered on his handsome face. "Please!"
                                            I was breathless. My stomach hurt from laughing so much. Evan was on top of me, straddling me. We came back to his room when it got too cold out in the dock. "Say it!" he repeated, his fingers moving faster
                                            on my sides. "I can't-" I choked in my own words. The sensation was bittersweet. I was laughing but my stomach was hurting and my lungs protesting from the lack of air. I couldn't keep this for long but I so
                                            didn't want to give up. "I can go on forever, just say the words," Evan grinned wickedly. "Never!" I shouted dramatically, pushing his chest. He didn't even budge. I wriggled beneath him like a wild anaconda
                                            but he simply chuckled as he continued to tickle me to death. "Say the words," he sang playfully. I was going to die of laughter, literally. However, dying with Evan on top of me didn't seem so bad to me. Evan
                                            intensified his tickling attack. I reached a point of laughter when no sound came out of my mouth and I knew I had to surrender if I didn't want to die for real. "Fine! I'll say it!" I gave in. He stopped tickling
                                            me to stare down at me expectantly. His dark eyes filled with amusement. I had a hard time catching my breath. My chest was rising and falling quickly. "I'm all ears," he said victoriously. Moonlight streamed
                                            through the window brushing his handsome features. "You..." Arg! I hated losing. I definitely hadn't thought this through when I'd started a tickling war. "Yes?" "You are sexy poet," I muttered reluctantly.
                                            Evan's grin grew wide. "And?" he pressed. God, he was enjoying this way too much. "I am..." I looked away from him blushing. He held my chin forcing me to look back at him. "Don't look away from me. I want to
                                            see you when you say it," he commanded leaning down to me. My heart pounded fast inside my chest at his closeness. We were so close I could see how his dark pupils dilated slightly. His uneven breath brushed
                                            past my lips. His nose touched mine in a slow gentle caress "say it," his tone was soft but demanding. "I am completely yours," I stated breathless and this time it wasn't because of laughter, it was because
                                            of my boyfriend's closeness. He closed the space between us and kissed me. God, I loved the way his lips molded against mine so perfectly as if we were made for each other. the kiss was soft and slow but it
                                            still got my heart racing my chest. His hand stroke my cheek gently as our lips moved in sync. He tasted really good. I brought my hands to his face pulling him even closer to me. He sucked on my lower lip mildly,
                                            stealing a sigh from me. He took the opportunity to slide his tongue inside my mouth. The kiss became more urgent and passionate. I found myself tangling my fingers in his soft hair as his tongue explore my
                                            mouth. Our breaths were getting heavy, my entire body was tingling in places I didn't know they could. Evan shifted in his straddling position to lie on top of me. The sensation of his body pressed against mine
                                            was amazing. He continued kissing me fervently. His fingers traced down my cheek to my neck slowly. The contact sent waves of desire through me. I wanted his hand to go further down. Blame it on my hormones,
                                            but I was dying for his touch. I wanted him to touch me. I arched up pressing my boobs against his clothed chest. Evan moaned softly in my mouth. The sound was sexy as hell, it was like fuel to the burning fire
                                            currently running through my veins. I broke the kiss needing to breathe. He buried his face in my neck giving me butterflies kisses everywhere. I let out a shy moan. That felt good. I didn't know what's gotten
                                            into me but I flipped him over to straddle him. I gasped feeling how hard he was against my core. I looked down at his face. He was staring at me, his mouth parted as he breathed heavily. His eyes held a glint
                                            of lust. His hands gripped my hips tightly. I bit my lip staring back at him. He sat up, and rested his forehead in mine. We were both trying to catch our breaths. We knew we couldn't go further than this because
                                            God, I was sure I wasn't going to be able to stop if we did. Evan kissed me shortly. My lips were swollen and sensitive. He nibbled on my lower lip teasingly. I pushed his chest. "Ow!" I whined, glaring playfully
                                            at him. He grinned, his signature dimples forming in his cheeks. I struggled not to squeal saying 'he's so cute' he held my face with both hands and looked right into my eyes. "Thank you," he said seriously.
                                            "Huh?" I frowned confused. "For being so damn stubborn," he smiled. His thumbs were caressing my cheek "thank you for not giving up on me even when I was being a jerk to you," I held his hand and kissed his
                                            palm not breaking eye contact. "What can I say? I have a thing for sexy poets," I shrugged. He cocked an eyebrow. "So you're admitting I'm sexy?" he asked arrogantly. "Maybe," I shrugged again. "Maybe?" "Yeah,"
                                            he pinched my waist "No! no more tickling! Please!" I begged, shaking my head. "You do realize you're in my dark cave alone?" he smirked at me. I swallowed, nodding "Aren't you afraid of the big bad shark?"
                                            I shook my head "You should! Rawr!" he roared. I burst into laughing. "Did you... did you just... roar?" I asked still laughing so hard my stomach was starting to hurt. Evan was watching me, amused. "Yes, did
                                            I scare you?" "Sharks don't roar, silly!" I stated, poking his forehead. "Is that so?" he whispered pretending a dangerous tone "The shark feels insulted! You shall feel his wrath!" he exclaimed dramatically.
                                            I shrieked as he pushed me down, forcing me to lay on my back. He crawled on top of me, making growl noises. I was laughing again. "What are you doing?" I gasped when he buried his face in my neck, kissing,
                                            licking and biting it gently. I wriggled beneath him. "Rawr!" he purred in my ear, sending shivers through me. I loved this playful side of him, he was so funny. I really loved Evan. I can't deny a part of me
                                            was sad because he hadn't said he loved me back but I pushed all those thoughts away and decided to enjoy being with him to the fullest. ** It's so warm here... Something warm was brushing my closed eyelids.
                                            It dragged me out of a good sleep. I opened my eyes slowly, orange invaded my blurred sight. Orange? I frowned. Last time I checked Evan's room was totally black. After blinking repeatedly, I realized it was
                                            sunlight brushing my face, it was coming in through a small gap between the curtains. I yawned, sitting up. I looked at my side to see Evan. He was lying on his stomach, his pale face was half-buried in his
                                            pillow. He looked so vulnerable. I felt like cuddling with him and staying in bed but I needed to pee, like right now. I crawled out of bed careful enough not to wake him and headed to the door. Cold air caressed
                                            my bare legs. It was then I looked down at my outfit, blushing fiercely. I was only wearing one of Evan's shirts. It barely reached my mid-thigh. Yeah, I know what you're thinking! No, we didn't have sex. I
                                            just changed into his shirt last night because it was more comfortable than Helen's tight clothes. We did made out like crazy, and let's just say, things got a little touchy but we were strong enough not to
                                            surrender to our needs. Basically, because it was illegal and I really didn't want him to go to jail because of me. But also, because come on, he'd just asked me to be his girlfriend and even though I loved
                                            him, I wasn't going to lose my virginity so fast. I wasn't ready. Yawning, I stepped out of the room, closing the door carefully behind me. I turned on my heels ready to head to the bathroom. Unfortunately for
                                            me, Laura was coming out of the bathroom in that precise moment. Her jaw dropped to the floor. Her eyes almost popped out of their sockets. "Oh my God!" she squealed, jumping up and down. "Shhh!" I placed my
                                            index on my mouth as I jogged towards her. "Oh my God! Oh my God!" she repeated loudly. When I reached her, I pushed her inside the bathroom, kicking the door closed behind me. "Shut up!" "Oh my God! you're
                                            wearing his shirt!" she chirped excited "Did you... Oh God! I can't breathe!" "Calm down!" I shook her by her shoulders. "I can't! This is so exciting!" she fanned herself with her hands "His shirt looks so
                                            good on you!" "Lau! I'm going to slap you if you don't calm down," I warned her but couldn't help smiling at her reaction. "Ok, Ok, breathe in, breathe out," she repeated this until she was slightly calmed.
                                            "That's better," I let go of her shoulders. She giggled like a five years old "What happened? You need to tell me everything! Every single detail!" she demanded sitting on bathroom's counter. I sighed. After
                                            brushing my teeth and peeing, which can be very uncomfortable with Lau in the same room but she refused to leave, I told her the entire story. From waking up in the middle of the night, to how we ended up in
                                            his room. Lau listened to me attentively looking sad when I told her Evan's heartbreaking story but then squealing and giggling when I told her how he asked me to be his girlfriend. When we reached the part
                                            of him and me making out, she bombarded me with questions. "How was it? Did it hurt? I can't believe you lost your virginity first! I-" "Whoa, whoa! slow down, girl!" I raised my hands "I didn't have sex with
                                            him," she stared at me confused "I'm only wearing his shirt because it was more comfortable," I explained further. "But you slept with him?" "Yeah," "And you didn't do anything?" she asked skeptically. I nodded
                                            "Anything at all?" I blushed. "Well..." "I knew it!" she clapped her hands "Tell me!" I opened my mouth to say something but then the door burst opened revealing a frowning shirtless Jordan. He looked between
                                            Lau and me. "What's going on here?" he folded his arms across his chest. His eyes scanned my outfit and I felt the need to pull shirt down a little bit more "Is that...? Oh," he said in realization. "Come here,
                                            babe," Lau extended her arms to him. He obeyed, positioning himself between her legs against the counter. She embraced him from behind, resting her chin on his shoulder to look at me. "What's up with all the
                                            squealing over here?" Jordan asked, amused "Did someone have a wild night?" he wiggled his eyebrows suggestively. I rolled my eyes. "It's not what it looks like," I said sitting on the toilet bowl. Jordan chuckled.
                                            "Jules was telling the details when you came in," Lau chimed in. "I want to hear those details, too," Jordan said interested. "I'm not going to-" "What the hell is going on here?" Jason cut me off, entering
                                            the bathroom. I let out a long sigh "What are you guys doing here?" he scowled at us and then took in my appearance "Holy shit! You're wearing a guy's shirt!" he covered his mouth in shock. "She slept with Evan,"
                                            Lau informed him, grinning from ear to ear. "She what?!" I swear, Jason just spitted me. "Lau!" I whined, knowing Jason would get the wrong idea. "Jules!" Jason grasped my shoulders, pulling me to my feet "What
                                            happened?!" he asked, shaking me by my shoulders so hard I was getting dizzy "He took advantage of you, didn't he? Say one word and I'll kill him!" Jordan and Lau were laughing their asses off. "Jason, don-"
                                            "Oh God!" he held my face protectively "My poor innocent Jules!" roughly; he pulled me into a tight hug, caressing my hair. "Jason, sto-" I muffled against his bare chest. He smelled like sex and a woman's perfume.
                                            I pushed him away when I realized he'd probably been having sex with Helen all night since this was her house. "Ew! Hands off! You stink of sex!" I complained, scrunching my nose in disgust. "Says the girl wearing
                                            a guy's shirt," he shot back reprovingly. "How was it? Did you enjoy it?" Jordan chimed in, enjoying this way too much. I let out a exasperated sigh. "I didn-" "That bastard!" Jason muttered, clenching his fists
                                            as his sides "I can't believe you let him have his way with you!" "Dude, it's not a big deal," Jordan shrugged. "Not a big deal?!" Jason exclaimed becoming red "She fucking lost her virginity!" "You were a virgin?"
                                            Jordan looked surprised. "Who's a virgin?" Helen asked, stepping inside the bathroom. Oh God! I clutched my forehead frustrated. Helen scanned the place, when her eyes landed on me, she squinted at me "Is that
                                            my brother's shirt?" "No,no, I mean yes but... it's not-" "You're screwing my brother?" Helen asked in disbelief. "She slept with him," Lau corrected it as if her statement was clarifying anything. Truth was,
                                            it was only making everything messier. "That's a nice way to put it," Jason commented angrily. "It seems like it was a wild night, look at her hair," Jordan stated chuckling. "That's my normal morning hair!"
                                            I defended with a stomp of my foot. How we all managed to fit in this small bathroom, I had no idea. "You and my brother," Helen mumbled, relief plastered on her face. It seemed like she finally understood there
                                            was nothing between Jason and me. "Tell me you at least use protection," Jason pleaded worriedly. "What?" I seriously wanted to slap my best friend right now. "Are you ovulating?" Helen inquired, probably concerned
                                            about being an premature aunt. "I... Oh God!" "Oh God?" Jason imitated my voice "What does that suppose to mean?" "Shut up!" I screamed at everyone "I did not have sex last night!" I clarified annoyed "I am
                                            still a virgin!" I yelled at them. "Good to know," a female voice said from the door. We all snapped our heads towards the source. "Melissa?" What the hell was she doing here? Great, I could officially say everyone
                                            knew I was a virgin. Awkward... "Helen," Melissa said, completely ignoring me "I need your help," "What's wrong?" Helen inquired focused on her. "Shane," Melissa stated as if that was all she needed to say for
                                            Helen to understand. "What about him?" Jordan interrupted. Melissa sighed. "I found him in a near-by bar a few hours ago. He was wasted. It took me forever to drag him here but he refuses to get out of the car,"
                                            Melissa explained tiredly. "Where's your car?" Jordan got off the counter, all playfulness gone from his face. "Outside," "And you let him alone?" Jordan reprehended. "He can't even move properly," she shrugged.
                                            I was too shocked to say something I thought Shane had left with some red-headed. What was he doing in a bar getting wasted all by himself? We all headed outside. I, of course, stayed at the porch. It wasn't
                                            like I could walk outside in this outfit. Jordan and Jason dragged Shane out of the car. Let me tell you something, Shane was a mess. He was still wearing his jeans shorts from yesterday. He was shirtless, his
                                            hair was disheveled. His eyes were half-closed. "I can walk!" Shane slurred slapping Jordan's arms. Stumbling and swinging from side to side he came towards me. His eyes widened when he spotted me "Little minion!"
                                            he exclaimed opening his arms to me. "Shane, you need to go to bed," Melissa recommended. I could see the tireless in her eyes. "Bed?" he huffed "I need another drink," "Bro, I think you'd have enough drinks
                                            for the day," Jordan said grasping his shoulder. "Psst! I'm not going to bed!" he rubbed a hand over his face shakily "i'm fine!" "Shane," my voice seemed to catch his attention. His face softened. "Yeah, little
                                            minion?" "Go to bed," he grinned at me. "Why?" he loomed over me, the smell of alcohol hit my nostrils making me grimace. "You need to rest," "But I don't want to," he pouted. "I'll take care of this," I announced
                                            to the guys before wrapping a hand around Shane's arm to pull him behind me. Reluctantly, he followed me. I had no idea of where to take him since this wasn't my house. All I knew it had to be one of the rooms
                                            around here, not upstairs because there was no way Shane could walk upstairs like this. I dragged him past the kitchen into a semi-dark hallway. I checked a few doors before finding a room. It had a single bed
                                            on the corner. I pulled Shane inside with me. He leaned against the wall whilst I started fixing the covers for him to get in. I heard the door closed behind me and I turned on my heels as fast as I could. Shane
                                            had a wicked grin on his face. He locked the door and started approaching me. "Got ya!" he said victoriously. x M W L x A/N: My birthday is coming! My birthday is coming! My birthday is on October 5th so it's

                                            a thriller movie? Because I certainly felt like it was one. You know that moment when the victim gets caught by the killer inside a small area? Yeah, I was living it. I took a step backwards scared. The back
                                            of my legs touched the bed, letting me know I had no escape. Shane still had that wicked grin on his face. This room looked too small for him to fit. What was he up to? He took a step forwards, determination
                                            plastered on his face. Although, his eyes seemed unfocused. "Shane," I called him, getting his attention "what are you doing?" he didn't reply, taking another step in my direction. It made me wonder if he was
                                            pretending to be drunk to trap me like this. He wouldn't do that, right? "Jules, Jules, Jules," he repeated my name deliberately slow. I scowled at him. "What are you doing?" I was scrutinizing him, trying to
                                            see if he was lying about being drunk. Shane's brown eyes were slightly narrowed as if he was having a hard time to see me well "Are you really drunk?" Shane's grin grew bigger but didn't say anything. However,
                                            I got my reply when a very loud sound left his lips: A hiccup followed by a drunken giggle. I rolled my eyes, relaxing my shoulders "Let's get you to bed," "No," he shook his head stubbornly. "Come on," I grabbed
                                            his shoulder and pulled him to the bed. Being obviously his drunk-self, Shane lost his equilibrium and fell on the bed. I took the chance to pull the covers over him. When he finally was lying on his back, I
                                            knew it was time for me to leave. Apparently, Shane thought otherwise because he held both of my wrists, forcing me to sit next to him. "Wait, don't go, I..." he muttered something else but I couldn't catch
                                            it. "What?" "I think I'm drunk," "Really?" I chuckled "How did you get to that preposterous conclusion?" I said sarcastically. He gave me a small smile. "Because I want to say something I shouldn't say," I frowned.
                                            "And what is that?" "Why?" I gave him a confused look "Why him?" I froze. "What are you talking about?" I scrunched my eyebrows together and tipped my head to the side. "Freaky boy," he said, moistening his
                                            dry lips "why did you choose him?" "I-" "Wait," he cut me off "don't answer that." He demanded with a pained expression. "Shane..." "You were always getting under my skin, Jules. Somehow, you managed to crawl
                                            your way over my heart," he mumbled, eyes half-closed. My eyes widened. I stared at him, waiting for him to laugh and say it was all a joke but it never happened. Did he just... no, he was drunk. He couldn't
                                            be serious. He was Shane Mason, the school's popular jerk... he couldn't be interested in me. God, this is so clichÃ©. I needed to get out of here, "You're drunk. You need to get some sleep," I struggled to get
                                            his hand off my wrists. "You changed me," he whispered, eyes fully closed this time "I've always been a player. That's how I do things. That's who I am. I liked it that way, everything was easier but then you
                                            walked into my life." he looked so vulnerable "You expected me to be better... and that made me want to be better. You woke up my curiosity. For the first time in years, I wanted to know how it is to have feelings,
                                            real feelings. I realized sex is not the only thing two people can share. You have no idea how much you can affect someone, Jules," his voice was soft, almost a whisper. I was frozen in my spot. I couldn't bring
                                            myself to say something. He sighed, his lips twitched up forming a sad smile. He opened his brown eyes to look up at me "Shocking, isn't it?" he let go of my wrists to cup my cheek. "Shane, I-" he pressed his
                                            index finger on my lips. "You don't have to say anything," his eyes held so much emotion I felt my heart falter. I swallowed "I just need to get this out of my chest," he paused, sitting up clumsily. His face
                                            was mere inches from mine "I don't know what love feels like, but I can't get you out my head and all I can think about right now is how bad I wish you were wearing my shirt and not his," his thumb caressed
                                            my cheek "I want to protect you, to make you smile. I want to make you happy. I know it's too late for this but I have to say it," he pressed his forehead against mine "I love you, little minion," his alcohol
                                            impregnated breath blew past my lips "I have no idea how this happened, but I do. I love you, I love you," he gripped my face tightly. "Shane..." I trailed off, taken aback by his words. "God, it feels good
                                            to say it aloud," he slurred, chuckling. I closed my eyes, not knowing how to deal with his. I wasn't prepared for this. Heck, I would never have thought something like this would happen. Shane said he loved
                                            me. To say I was shocked was the biggest understatement of my life. Instead of feeling happy, I felt terrible because I didn't feel the same way at all. Sure Shane was hot and I may have felt physically attracted
                                            to him a few times but that was it. In my eyes, he was my friend, nothing else. My heart belonged to Evan. It was the first time a guy told me he loved me. It felt... strange. I wanted to hear those words so
                                            bad, but not coming from Shane. I wanted to hear them from Evan. I opened my eyes, realizing Shane was leaning forwards. I placed my hands on his chest gently stopping him. "Don't," I pleaded, removing his hand
                                            off my face. I couldn't let him kiss me because I would only do it out of pity and he didn't deserve that. Shane looked down. "I thought I would get a kiss after that embarrassing confession," he smiled but
                                            it didn't reach his eyes. "I'm sorry," I said frankly. "Not even a peck?" he asked hopefully. I shook my head "Bah, you're not like that Bella girl from Twilight, are you?" I knew he referred to the fact, Bella's
                                            character had feelings for two guys and she let the second kiss her betraying her boyfriend. "Sorry, I'm a faithful girl," "I know," he fell back on the bed, hiccupping again "I'm sleepy," I got on my feet "Sleep
                                            well, Shaney," I headed to the door. "And Jules?" I heard him whisper from behind. "Yeah?" I said, grasping the doorknob. "If he messes up, I will be here for you," he slurred. "Okay," I walked out of the room,
                                            resting my back against the closed door. I closed my eyes, rubbing my face. What the hell just happened? The Anti-chips loved me? What had the world come to? Global warming didn't seem to be affecting the environment
                                            anymore. It was having an effect on humanity. "Jules?" I jumped at Evan's sexy voice. I snapped my head towards the beginning of the hallway. There he stood, in all his morning glory. Jesus! That was one sexy
                                            bed hair. I blushed remembering the events of last night. "Hum... Hi the-there," I stuttered nervously. I knew I hadn't done anything wrong but I still felt like I just got caught. Evan squinted at me. "What
                                            are you doing down here?" he folded his arms across his chest. "I was just..." I glanced at the closed door. I love you, little minion My brain was still processing everything, "I was helping Shane," I finished,
                                            pushing that thought to the back of my mind. "You mean, you let him see you like this?" he gestured my outfit. "Yeah but he was-" "You can't just go walking around looking like this," he said disapprovingly.
                                            He came closer to me "You're my girlfriend now. I don't want anyone else seeing you like this, especially not him," he wrapped his lean arms around my waist. "Sorry, I wasn't really thinking when I left the
                                            room," he leaned down to give me a short kiss. My heart raced in my chest, the wild dragons fluttered in my stomach. It felt so good to be in his arms. I got on my tiptoes, wrapping my arms around his neck.
                                            I loved kissing him. I loved the way my entire body tingled when he was close to me. "Get a room!" I heard someone yell. Evan and broke the kiss but still kept out bodies pressed together. We looked at the source
                                            of that voice. Lau was walking towards us "I have good news and bad news," she informed us. "What happened?" I asked curious, getting some space between Evan and me. "Bad news: the road won't be ready until
                                            tomorrow, I'm hungry and I don't want to cook and Jason and Jordan are eating everything in the kitchen as we speak " she said enumerating with her fingers "Good news: I've already planned an awesome day for
                                            all of us since we have to stay over another night," "Did you even ask Evan if we could stay over again?" I gave her a disapproving look "It's his house, remember?" Lau grinned. "I'm sure he won't mind," she
                                            glanced at him "right, Evan?" he smiled at her. "No, I don't mind. As long as she's here," he wrapped his arms around me from behind "I'm okay with it," he kissed my cheek tenderly. "Aww! He's so cute," Lau
                                            made a dreamy face. I couldn't help blushing a little "but I was serious about you two getting a room. I mean, there are too many in this house. You don't need to make out in the middle of the hallway," Evan
                                            chuckled. "Lau!" "Fine! I'm leaving," she turned on her heels, winked at me, and left. "That girl is going to be the death of me," I mumbled. Evan tightened his arms around my waist. I could feel his body pressed
                                            against mine from behind. "She's funny," Evan commented, kissing the curve where my shoulder and neck meet. A pleasurable shiver ran down my spine. His breath was brushing my skin teasingly. "Evan..." I whispered
                                            dropping my head back, giving him more access to my neck. "Yes?" "Let's get a room," I offered, closing my eyes. x M W L x A/N: Shanish chapter, huh? He had to vent his feelings at some point. Hope you enjoyed

                                            Chapter 33 "Put these on," Evan stated as he threw some shorts at me. I scowled at him, unfolding the shorts in front of me. They were too big for me. Reluctantly, I put them on tightening the waistband so they
                                            wouldn't fall off. I kept scowling at my boyfriend who was now putting a t-shirt on. Apparently when I'd said 'Let's get a room' he heard it as 'Let's get you dressed' because when we got back to his room, he'd
                                            only tried to get me to dress properly. However, I wasn't complaining. I was watching how his muscles flexed as he pulled the dark t-shirt down his body. How could he look so sexy doing something so simple as
                                            that? My mouth watered as I stared at the sexy V in his lower abdomen until the t-shirt covered it down. I mentally whimpered, wanting to stare at his sexy body all day. Jeez, I was turning into a pervert. But
                                            dear God, he was just so perfect. I couldn't believe he was mine. I giggled happily. Evan looked at me, cocking an eyebrow. "What's so funny?" He asked, closing his drawers. "Erm, nothing," I waved my hands
                                            in front of me, smiling nervously. "Then why are you blushing?" He inquired, taking a step closer. I backed away cowardly. "I'm not blushing," I lied, lowering my head. Evan approached to me. His tangy smell
                                            hit my nose and I struggled not to sniff on him. His hand held my chin, forcing me to look up at him. His deep dark eyes stared into my blue ones intensively making my heart falter. I couldn't describe the way
                                            he made feel anymore. I just felt... Complete. Like I didn't need anything more to be happy, just him. He leaned forwards, his lips were merely an inch from mine. I was struggling not to close the distance between
                                            us. "You look sexy with my shirt on," he stated brushing his plump lips against mine. "Really?" Wow, my voice was so husky already. Evan nodded before kissing me softly. I eagerly kissed him back, wrapping my
                                            arms around his neck. My entire body heated up quickly. I loved feeling him so close to me. Our lips moved in sync as he gripped my waist tightly. I was becoming breathless while the kiss was getting deeper
                                            and more passionate. I felt his tongue traced my lips, asking for entrance which I quickly granted. His tongue explored my mouth sending waves of hot pleasure through every part of my body. Evan lifted me so
                                            I could wrap my legs around his hips. Instantly, I felt something hard pressed against me. I moaned in his mouth. He grunted, cupping my ass with both hands. I didn't realize I was grinding against him until
                                            I felt something building up inside me. Evan carried me towards the bed. That should have alarmed me but I wasn't thinking straight. I landed on my back with him on top of me. Our lips were glued together as
                                            metal to a magnet. My breath was ragged and uneven, his wasn't any better. My hands seemed to have a mind of their own, because they started tugging on his t-shirt until they pulled it over his head. My fingers
                                            traced down his defined chest and stomach. I wanted to feel the warm skin against mine so bad. Evan seemed to read my mind because in a not-so subtle movement he took my shirt off, throwing it away. Our naked
                                            torsos made contact, causing both of us to moan loudly. I could feel my warm breasts pressing against his soft skin. God, this feels so good. He broke the kiss, leaning back to look right into my eyes. There
                                            was so much emotion and need in them. He looked further down to my now bare breast. I was breathing heavily as I watched how his eyes darken with lust. I bit my lower lip, caressing his face. He kissed me again
                                            with so much passion; I couldn't do anything but respond. I knew we had to stop, there was a voice yelling at me in the back of my head but God, it felt too good to stop. His lips left mine to trail kisses down
                                            my jaw until he buried his face in my neck. He licked all the way down into the valley of my breasts. I was muffling moans as I arched up towards him. I didn't stop him when he began pulling down my shorts.
                                            I knew I couldn't stop him even when that was the rational thing to do. "Evan," I moaned his name. This seemed to excite him more because he groaned, licking down my stomach to my navel. His hot tongue felt
                                            so good against my burning skin. I tangled my fingers in his hair, bringing his face up to mine. I kissed him fervently, showing him how bad I wanted him through the kiss. "Bro, have you seen-Oh my God!" We
                                            both froze at Helen's voice "I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!" She repeated, embarrassment cleared in her voice. Evan jumped off me so fast I barely had time to cover my chest. Wrapping the sheets around my naked
                                            torso, I sat up to face Helen. "It's okay," I said out of breath. I knew my face was as red as a cherry but I tried my best to keep my expression normal. My boyfriend didn't seem fazed by the entire awkward
                                            situation. He simply looked annoyed at the interruption. "What do you want?" He asked dryly, putting his t-shirt back on. "Well," Helen started awkwardly not even glancing at us "I was looking for Jules," "Me?"
                                            "Yeah," Helen kept her eyes anywhere but us "we're all going to hang out by the pool and Laura told me you don't have any bathing suit so, yeah, I thought you could borrow some of mine," "Oh," I said surprised.
                                            That was really nice of her "I'll be with you in a second," she mumbled okay and stepped out, closing the door behind her. We were left alone again. Evan's hungry gaze met mine and I just knew I needed to get
                                            the hell out of that room before we did something we could regret. Evan walked to me and handed me the shirt I was wearing. I waited for him to turn around or close his eyes. I know it sounds silly since I was
                                            pretty sure he had seen my breasts so close he could actually drawn them if he wanted to; But that didn't mean I was going to be an exhibitionist now. I wasn't confident enough for that. "Can you..." I trailed
                                            off, not actually knowing how to say it. Evan stared at me curiously. "Yes?" I caught the amusement in his voice. I swallowed. "Could you turn around?" Evan chuckled. "You're really silly," he shook his head,
                                            giving his back to me. Hurriedly, I put the t-shirt on "Ready," I said, getting up from the bed. Evan turned to me, smiling. I narrowed my eyes at him "What?" "Nothing," he shrugged. "What is it?" he bit his
                                            lip as if holding back from laughing. "Nothing," "Come on, spit it out," he chuckled. "Well, you forgot there was a mirror there," he pointed behind him. My mouth formed a big O when I realized he actually saw
                                            me changing through the mirror "It was quite of a view," he teased, grinning widely. I grasped one of the pillows and started hitting him with it. "You should have told me!" I exclaimed, attacking him mercilessly.
                                            Evan was laughing his ass off. Apparently, my pillow's blows were only tickling him because I didn't hear one single moan of pain from him "I hate you!" I growled ashamed. "No, you don't," "I do!" "You don't,"
                                            he stuck his tongue out at me. I glared at him. "You're so immature," I accused. "Says the girls starting a pillow fight," he shot back mockingly. I held my pillow tightly and attempted to slam it on his face
                                            but he caught it in mid-air, startling me. He smirked, giving one strong pull at the pillow. I stumbled forwards until I crashed against his chest. He wrapped his arms around me, keeping me prisoner. "Let me
                                            go!" I wriggled in his arms, trying to fight for my dignity. "No," he held me tight. "Evan!" "Yes, Jules?" his tone was teasing but I couldn't help shivering when he said my name. "Let me go!" "Never," he whispered
                                            in my ear "I will never let you go, I-" "Jules?" Helen's voice sounded annoyed at the other side of the door "I can come back later," I had totally forgotten about her. "No, I'm coming!" I shouted. Evan released
                                            me. "Go," he gave me a little push. I started heading to the door when he grabbed my hand to swirl me abruptly. In a matter of seconds, his lips crashed into mine. It was a soft kiss but it still got my heart
                                            racing in my chest. He pulled away, caressing my cheeks with his thumbs "i'll see you at the pool," I nodded my head, smiling up at him. He kissed my nose, letting go of my face. I stepped out of the room with
                                            a stupid grin on my face. Helen noticed it because she smiled knowingly at me. She looked very pretty with her perfect straight brown hair falling at the sides of her face and her cute little green eyes. My
                                            best friend had a good taste with woman. "Hey," she waved her hand. Her sudden change of attitude towards me wasn't really shocking. I mean, she just found me in a very compromising position with her brother.
                                            If that didn't convince her about me and Jason just being friends, I didn't know what it would "follow me," she started walking down the hallway. She led me to a pink room. When I entered, it felt like it was
                                            some alternative reality because everything was so bright and happy in this room. It was the opposite of Evan's room. "I took all the blows for her," Evan's words came to my mind. It was pretty clear Helen was
                                            a happy person. I admired Evan for taking so much care of his little sister. It was very brave of him to deal with all those years of abuse and protect his sister at the same time, making sure she had a normal
                                            childhood. "Earth to Jules!" Helen snapped her fingers in front of me "I know it's a lot of pink but what can I say?" she shrugged "I'm a girly girl," I smiled at her. "Your room is really pretty," "I know,"
                                            she said smugly. For a moment, I felt jealous of her. Helen looked so confident about herself, it was like she wasn't afraid of being herself. After practically swimming through her clothes-she had the biggest
                                            closet I'd seen in my life- we chose a cute swimsuit and pair of jeans shorts. It was a good thing Helen was almost my size. I used her bathroom to change and when I stepped out, Helen clapped her hands. "Perfect!"
                                            she chirped excitedly "You have a nice body, Jules." "Thanks," I mumbled shyly. "Ok, listen, there's something I need to say," she cleared her throat. I stared at her curious. "Yeah?" "I'm sorry for getting
                                            all bitchy with you. I just... I don't know. I guess, hearing so many stories about best friends falling in love clouded my mind. Jason and you seemed so close to each other, I just... I'm sorry." she ran her
                                            fingers through her hair nervously. "You love him, don't you?" she seemed surprise by my question. "What? I-" "I can see it in your eyes," I cut her off. Helen opened her mouth to deny it but then closed it,
                                            letting out a long sigh. "I do. I don't know how it happened. It just... did," "Does he know?" "No!" Helen jumped to her feet "And you can't tell him," "I won't," I held up my pinky "Pinky promise!" We were
                                            in a pink room, making pinky promises. We were so cool. Helen laughed shortly and poked my forehead. "You're something," she shook her head, chuckling. "Does this mean I have your approval?" I asked hopefully.
                                            "My approval?" she frowned. "You know, with your brother..." I trailed off purposefully. "I think my brother is too old for that. You don't need my approval," "But I want your approval," I said honestly. Helen
                                            sighed. "Fine," she shrugged "I guess, you have it then," I grinned "but if you hurt him, I will personally kick your ass," "I know," "And I will have no mercy," "I know," "And I know Karate," "Okay," "And-"
                                            "Okay! Okay! I get it!" I said exasperated. Helen's phone beeped. "We better head out to the pool. They're waiting for us," She stated, checking her texts. "Actually, I'm kind of hungry," I admitted embarrassed.
                                            "There are snacks there," Helen started walking out of the room. Snacks? My face brightened up. "Do you have any Ruffles?" I asked, following her close. ** "Eureka!" Jason shouted as he jumped inside the pool,
                                            splashing water everywhere. "Jason!" Helen and Lau whined as water splattered on them. I chuckled, it was a good thing I was a few feet away. "Yoohoo!" Jason exclaimed as soon as he came up to the surface. He
                                            raised his fists in the air as if he won some price. He was as excited as little boy in front of a candy shop. Jason loved pools like really loved them. I remembered one time when we were nine, we went to some
                                            ranch with a huge pool. Jason didn't get out of it until it was nighttime. We had to drag him out, literally. I smiled to myself, shaking my head at my best friend childish behavior. I was so glad to have him
                                            in my life. I didn't know what I would do without him. I was having a great time. Jordan had prepared delicious hot dogs with some sauce he made himself. Let me tell you, that boy knew how to cook. Shane had
                                            woken up and was currently sprawled in a beach chair like a stringless puppet. He was wearing big dark sunglasses. The sun was his biggest enemy due his pretty obvious hangover. I was sure a part of him was
                                            still drunk. I mean, he'd slept like four hours. I was sure alcohol hadn't left his system so fast. To be honest, I'd expected things to be weird between us but when he'd came out of the house he was his usual-self
                                            which means he annoyed the hell out of me and teased me about my hair. Apparently, that's what you do after you tell someone you love them. You make fun of them. Very classy, Shane. There was also the possibility
                                            of him not remembering what he said. And I was obviously not going to ask him if he did. What was I going to say: Hey, Shane. This morning when you came here wasted, you told me you loved me. Do you remember
                                            that? Awkward... Sighing, I kept eating my Ruffles. I was enjoying the sight in front of me. All my friends were there, having fun. Jason and Helen were splashing water to each other in a flirty way. Jordan
                                            and Lau were kissing like the world was going to end in a few minutes. Ok, that kiss was getting steamy too fast. I was sure the scene was going to turn Rated very soon. I scanned the ground around me and grasped
                                            a ball we've been playing with an hour ago. I placed my bag of ruffles on my lap. Rule #4 of Julie Ann Jones' life: Always make sure the Ruffles are safe before making a rough movement. I threw the ball at them
                                            efficiently hitting Jordan's head. "Let's keep it PG, guys!" I yelled at them. Jordan glared at me, rubbing his head. I smiled innocently at him. You're probably wondering where my hot boyfriend is, aren't you?
                                            He was actually getting out of the pool at the moment. He had gone for a swim. I gaped at him as he walked towards me; water droplets were running down his broad chest and defined stomach, drowning in the V
                                            formed in his lower abdomen. He raked his fingers through his wet hair, causing the muscles of his arms to flex. He bent down to give me a peck. His lips felt cold and wet against my warm ones. "Come with me,"
                                            he whispered, his breath fanning my lips. "I'm not getting in the pool anytime soon," "I know," he said, holding my hand "I just want to be alone with you for a second," "If this is some way to get me to stand
                                            so you can throw in the pool, I will kill you," "I'm so scared," Evan mocked with a girly voice. "I'm serious," "Relax, I'm not going to throw you in the pool," "Ok," I stood up cautiously. He held my hand tightly
                                            and pulled behind him. I realized we were heading to the woods behind his house. "Where are you guys going?!" I head Lau ask from behind. I glanced at her over my shoulder and mouthed 'I don't know' to her.
                                            "Use protection!" Jason shouted loudly. My cheeks were tinted red. "Jason!" Lau smacked him on the head. "What? She's too young to have a baby," Jason told her. "Oh God, shut up!" Lau pulled him under water
                                            "Have fun," she winked at me. When we were a little deep in the woods, Evan stopped letting go of my hand. He didn't face me though, he kept his back to me. I noticed how he was trying to relax his shoulders.
                                            What was wrong with him? He seemed tensed. Was he cold? I mean, he was dripping wet. Not knowing what to do, I took a look around. I spotted a tree house. "You're not afraid of heights, are you?" Evan asked,
                                            glancing at me over his shoulder. "No," "Come on," he said, gesturing me to the wooden stairs hanging from the tree house. "Okay," We climbed our way up slowly. I wasn't afraid of heights but I wasn't a fan
                                            of them either. When I was finally inside the tree house, I was surprise to find it very comfy There was a small couch at the corner next to a carved window. There were papers everywhere; there was also a wooden
                                            desk with a small battery lamp. "Wow, this is so nice," I complimented. "You're the first girl I've brought here," Evan said all of the sudden. I looked at him; he was using some towel to dry himself. "Really?"
                                            "Actually no," my heart sank in my chest "you're the first person I've brought to this place," my face lit up. "I feel special," I said, smiling at him. "You have no idea how special you are," the sincerity
                                            in his voice warmed my heart. "Thanks, I guess," I replied shyly. "This is the place where I write my poems," he added "I wrote that poem for you over there," he pointed the couch behind me. "You're a great
                                            poet," I said honestly, remembering his breath-taking poem. "I know," he smirked smugly. I rolled my eyes "Come here," he opened his arms for me. I jumped to his arms, not caring about getting damp. We held
                                            into each other tightly. I loved feeling him close to me. We pulled away but stayed close to each other. I looked into his deep black eyes, getting lost in them. The moment was just so perfect. I wanted to stay
                                            like this forever. Who could have thought I would find love in a eBook community? Who could have thought writing a simple cheesy story would bring me face to face to the man of my life? Life was truly unpredictable.
                                            When it comes to love, everything is possible. There are no limits, no barriers. My love was unconventional and I was not ashamed of it. In fact, it was the opposite. I was proud and happy. If you're happy,
                                            that's all that matters at the end. "Jules," Evan's sultry voice brought me back to reality "I wrote another poem for you," his thumbs caressed my cheeks tenderly. "You want to show it to me?" I was really excited
                                            about it. "No," he grinned. "No?" I scowled at him. "I want to recite it for you," "Oh," I said surprised. "You ready?" his deep eyes were holding me prisoner. "Yes," I was nervous. "It's sort of a continuation
                                            for The Girl and The shark," "Alright," "Look into my eyes. Never look away," he instructed, taking a deep breath in. "Ok," He opened his mouth and then angel's music filled my ears as he recited the poem for
                                            me. "The Shark hopes for salvation, Since the day he's found light, Daring to risk everything, Just for a taste of delight. His soul is still marked, Filled with scars and pain, But now that he's not alone,
                                            They're nothing but remains. The girl was stubborn, Her brightness blinding and strong, She never gave up, She kept fighting all along. She saw beyond that mask of coldness, She stayed even when she got hurt,
                                            The shark admired silently, Her big wonderful spurt. Staring into those eyes of yours, That are amazingly blue, I open my heart to tell you, How much I love you" My heart melted. My eyes were filled with upcoming
                                            tears, tears of happiness, I supposed. That was such a beautiful way to tell me he loved me. "I love you, Jules," he spoke softly. "I love you, too," my voice broke a little. Then, he kissed me with so much
                                            love, I felt like I was floating away from Earth to the planet of happiness. Ok that was a little bit cheesy back there but that's me, I would always be cheesy Jules and he would always be my dark poet. Remember...
                                            Don't be afraid to be different, Be yourself in all your glory, My name is Julie Ann Jones, and that was My Wattpad Love story. THE END. X My Wattpad Love x Credits: "Jason! What the hell are you doing? Get

                                            "That's because Shane is peeing in the pool," Lau chuckled. "What?! Shane!" -*-*- "So what does it feel to be left out in the last chapter?" Interviewer asks Melissa. "What do you think, b*tch?!" Melissa screams

                                        nila ako sa kaibigan nilang madre na nagpapalakad sa isang ampunan. Limang taon ako ng mga panahon na yon.</p>

                            iba kong panaginip, matapos nyang sabihin ang mga katagang yon, magigising na ako. Umupo ako sa kama at napatingin sa labas, umuulan. Napanaginipan ko na naman sya.
                            <p></p>
                            <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                            <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                            Ilang gabi ko na syang napapanaginipan. Kailan kaya kami magkikita? Alam ko na totoo sya.Ilang beses ko na syang sinubukan na hanapin. Pero hindi ko sya makita. Kahit sa school, wala sya. Nakapagtataka dahil uniform ng school na pinapasukan ko ang suot
                            nya. Siguro nga pa hindi ito ang tamang panahon para magkita kami.
                            <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                            <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                            Naghanda na ako para sa pagpasok ko. Pagkatapos kong mag-ayos, bumaba na ako papunta sa kusina para kumain. Mag-isa lang ako na nakatira sa malaking bahay na ito. Ang totoo, ulila na ako at lumaki ako sa isang bahay ampunan di kalayuan sa tinitirahan
                            ko. Nang mag-18 na ako, umalis na ako sa ampunan. Hindi naging problema para sa akin ang pera. Kahit eighteen years old pa lang ako, milyonarya na ako. Hindi dahil pinamanahan ako ng malaking halaga ng mga namayapa kong mga
                            magulang kundi dahil sa kakayahan ko na makita ang hinaharap. Madali lang sa akin ang malaman kung ano ang lalabas na numero sa lotto o ang resulta sa kahit na ano'ng pustahan. Isang regalo na ipinamana sa akin ng mga magulang
                            ko. Dahil sa kakayanan nilang 'yon kaya sila namatay. Kapag nakita ng isang katulad ko ang hinaharap, hindi ibig sabihin ay kaya ko na itong baguhin. Katulad ng mga magulang ko. Nakita nila kung ano ang kahihinatnan nila, alam
                            nilang mamamatay na sila kaya naman ibinigay nila ako sa kaibigan nilang madre na nagpapalakad sa isang ampunan. Limang taon ako ng mga panahon na yon. Nang iwan nila ako sa ampunan, hindi ko na sila nakita pang muli. Kaya
                            naman naging maingat ako sa pag-gamit ko sa kakayanan kong makita ang hinaharap. Isa 'yong leksyon, magtago at makihalo sa mga normal na tao. St. Charles Academy. Pangalan ng school na pinapasukan ko. Isa itong magandang eskwelahan
                            na para sa mga nasa high society. Ang totoo pangarap ko talaga na makapasok dito simula palang nang makita ko sya sa mga panaginip ko. Nang makita ko ang uniporme nya, pinilit ko na pumasok sa school na 'to. Hindi ko alam kung
                            bakit ko sya hinahabol, kung bakit ko sya gustong makita. Nung una, curious lang ako na makita sya. Pero nang tumagal ang mga panaginip ko, napansin ko na nahulog na pala ako sa kanya. Matangkad syang lalaki, sa tingin ko hanggang
                            balikat nya lang ako. Maganda ang tindig nya at kung pano nya dalhin ang uniporme namin.
                            <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                            <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                            May mukha sya na sa tingin ko ay hindi sanay sa pag-ngiti. Isang bagay na nalaman ko sa kanya, hindi sya isang pala ngiting tao. Pagpasok ko sa loob ng classroom ko dumiretso na agad ako sa pinakadulong upuan. As usual, walang kumakausap sa akin. Hindi
                            kasi ako pala-imik sa klase. Magsasalita lang ako kapag tinatanong pero bukod don wala na. Mas pinili ko na maging ganito, mas maingat. "Hey girls! Nandito na sila!!!" "Whaaaat?! Kyaaaah!!" Nagtakbuhan palabas ng classroom
                            ang mga kaklase kong babae. Ngayon darating ang mga transfered students. Sa pagkakaalam ko, anim silang puro lalaki. Tumayo ako at lumabas. Gusto ko rin silang makita, baka isa sa kanila ang hinahanap ko. Lahat ng nasa hallway
                            puro babae, kakaunti ang mga lalaki. "Galing sila sa Pendleton High alam nyo ba?" "Yes I know!" "Yung school na puro delinquents?!" "Oo yun nga! Isa yung private school para sa mga boys." "Pero bakit daw sila lumipat dito?"
                            "Well I heard na since umalis ang Lucky 13 sa school na 'yon, marami na ang naghari-harian na grupo sa school nila. Kaya nagkakagulo sa school na 'yon ngayon. Kaya siguro sila lumipat." "Gosh! Red is so hot! Naaalala ko nang
                            una ko syang makita, nakakatunaw ang tingin nya!" "Mas gwapo si Jack!" "Si Kyo ang type ko!" "Ano na nga pala ang nangyari sa leader ng group na 'yon? Bigla akong nawalan ng balita about him!" "I dunno!" "Hey look! Ayan na
                            sila!" "KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH~!!!" Napatakip ako ng tenga habang naka-tip toe na tumitingin sa direksyon kung saan nakatingin ang lahat. Anim silang mga lalaki na naglalakad sa gitna ng hallway. Sa pagkakasuot nila ng uniform
                            ng school, nagmukhang basang sisiw ang mga lalaki sa school na 'to. Magaling silang magdala ng damit. Naglalakad sila na parang hindi sila naaapektuhan ng tilian sa paligid. Yung ibang babae, literal na nakanganga. Nang medyo
                            malapit na sila, tinignan ko isa-isa ang mga mukha nila. Lahat sila nag-aangkin ng gwapong mukha. Ngayon lang ako nakakita ng mga ganitong klase ng mga lalaki. Kahit na magaganda ang mukha nila, hindi nababawasan ang dating
                            nila bilang lalaki. Hindi sila katulad ng lalaki sa school na 'to na sa sobrang ganda ng mukha ay nagiging babae na sa tingin ko.
                            <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                            <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                            Nang nasa harap ko na sila biglang lumingon sa akin ang isa sa kanila. Ang lalaking may blonde na buhok. *lub.dub.lub.dub* Napahawak ako sa dibdib ko. "Kyyaaa! Tinignan ako ni Ljoe! KYAAAA~! Kill me now!! Kinikilig ako!" Napatingin ako sa babae sa harap
                            ko. Siguro nga sya yung tinignan nung lalaki. Ljoe. Ang talas ng mga mata nya. Umalis na ako sa hallway at bumalik sa classroom. Wala sa kanila ang hinahanap ko. *** BAAM!! Nagulat ako sa tunog ng katabi kong locker. "Shit!"
                            Napatingin ako sa blonde na lalaking sumipa sa locker nya. Yung transfer student. Si Ljoe. Locker number 88. Ang locker na sira. Isang semester kong ginamit ang locker na yon. Sira ang handle non kaya mahirap buksan. Mabuti
                            na nga lang may mga gumraduate kaya nakakuha ako ng ibang locker. "Itulak mo muna, kabigin pakaliwa tsaka mo buksan," sabi ko habang inilalagay ang iba kong gamit sa locker ko. "Hindi ko kailangan ng tulong mo," mukhang sa
                            akin nya nabunton ang galit nya sa locker nya. Kaya ayokong nakikialam. Pero nung unang beses kong gamitin ang locker na yon, walang tumulong sa akin kaya nahirapan ako. Mabuti nalang naging matyaga ako. "Malas," bulong nya
                            habang tinititigan nang masama ang locker nya. Bumuntong hininga ako at isinara ko ang locker ko. Kawawa naman. Lumapit ako sa locker nya, binuksan ko. Humarap ako sa kanya pagkatapos. "Sa susunod alam mo na ang gagawin mo"
                            "Hindi ako magpapasalamat sa'yo. Bakit mo binuksan? Magpapalit na ako ng locker," tinabig nya ako at nilagay ang mga gamit nya sa locker "At hindi rin ako interesado sa mga babaeng mahilig makialam kaya kung umaasa ka na-"
                            "Hwag kang mag-alala, may boyfriend na ako," singit ko sa kanya "Hindi yan naging hadlang para sa mga babaeng humahabol sa akin," ngisi nya. "Hindi ako katulad ng ibang babae" "Ano naman ang ipinagkaiba nyo? Iisa lang ang takbo
                            ng pag-iisip nyong mga babae." "Hindi nalang ako makikipagtalo sa'yo since hindi naman kita kilala," tumalikod na ako umalis. May ilang tao talaga na kahit tulungan mo, iinsultuhin ka parin. *** Nagdaan ang ilang araw, hindi
                            ko na ulit naka-usap ang lalaking may dilaw na buhok. Minsan nakikita ko sya sa locker na parang may hinihintay, pero sa tuwing darating ako umaalis sya. Galit ba sya sa'kin? Siguro na-weirduhan sya sa'kin o baka naman narinig
                            nya ang mga usapan ng ibang estudyante tungkol sa'kin. Ang akala ko lilipat na sya ng locker, siguro naubusan sya ng pwedeng lipatan kaya nagtya-tyaga sya sa sirang locker nya. *** Sabado, kailangan kong magtrabaho ngayon.
                            Nagta-trabaho ako sa isang dessert shop. Ang Sweety's Sweets House kung saan co-owner ako at assistant manager ni Ate sweety. Ngayong araw wala si Ate Sweety dahil sa pag-aasikaso nya sa kasal nya. Kaya naman ako muna ang kailangan
                            mag- overtime ngayon. Kailangan kong manatili hanggang closing time para maayos ang tally. "Bye Ma'am" "Una na po kami" "Ingat po Ma'am" Tumango ako sa kanila. Pumatak na ang alas nuebe, nag-close na ang shop. Matagal bago
                            ko naayos ang records ng kinita ng shop ngayon. Gumawa na rin ako para sa deposit slips bukas. Araw- araw kailangan i-deposit ang kinita ng shop sa joint account namin ni Ate Sweety. 10:00pm na pagtingin ko sa relo ko. In-off
                            ko na ang laptop ko. Sinigurado ko rin na naka-lock sa safe box ang pera. Tumayo na ako at pinatay ang mga ilaw, lumabas ako at ni-lock ang pinto. Hindi naman malayo dito ang bahay ko. Sumakay na ako sa kotse ko at nagmaneho.
                            *BAAM!!BLAAG!!* May mga lalaking nagtatakbuhan. May away! Lumingon sa sasakyan ko ang isa sa kanila. At dahil sa ilaw ng kotse ko nakita ko ang mukha nya. Ang lalaking may pamilyar na dilaw na buhok. Si Ljoe. Nagulat sya nang
                            makita ako. "Ljoe! Sakay na!" tawag sa kanya ng isang lalaki sa motorsiklo. Hinahabol sila ng ilang mga lalaki.
                            <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                            <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                            Nagsisigawan. Ano'ng nangyayari? *** Pagsapit ng monday, paglapit ko sa locker ko hindi ko sya nakita. Imbes na si Ljoe ang makita ko, nakita ko ang isa pa sa mga transfer students. Namukhaan ko sya. Sya yung lalaking nakasakay sa pulang motorsiklo nung
                            sabado ng gabi. Isang napansin ko sa kanya, ang weird ng hairstyle nya. Kulay puti sa gilid at blonde sa gita. Lahat ba sila may weird na taste? Kung sabagay, galing sila sa Pendleton High, kung saan sanay sila na walang rules
                            na sinusunod. "Hi," bati nya sakin nang buksan ko ang locker ko Tinignan ko sya. Ako ba ang kinakausap nya? Sa'kin nga sya nakatingin. "Nagkita tayo nung isang gabi, natatandaan mo?" tanong nya Pinagmamasdan nya ako na parang
                            iniinspeksyon nya ako. "I'm CAP," pakilala nya Napatingin ako sa paligid nang maramdaman ang tingin sa akin ng ibang mga estudyante. Hindi ito maganda para sa'kin. Unti-unti na nila akong napapansin. Hindi ko nalang pinansin
                            si CAP. Ang weird ng pangalan nya. For short ba yon para sa totoo nyang pangalan? Nagmamadali kong kinuha ang mga gamit ko mula sa locker ko. Kailangan ko nang umalis dito. "Alam mo sa tingin ko kapag may nagpakilala sa'yo,
                            kailangan mo ring magpakilala sa kanila," sabi nya. Hindi ko sya pinansin at nagmamadali akong umalis. Sana lang hwag kumalat ang balita tungkol sa pakikipag-usap sa'kin ng isa sa mga new students. *** P.E. Ang subject kung
                            saan wala kaming masyadong ginagawa. Napag-alaman ko na karamihan sa mga estudyante sa school na to ay mas nanaisin maglabas ng IPad kaysa mag-exercise. Nasa gym kami, nakaupo sa bleachers samantalang ang mga lalaki ay naglalaro
                            ng basketball. Ginagawa lang nila yon para magpa-impress. Hindi ako nag-rereklamo. Ayoko rin ng PE. Hindi ako magaling sa sports. Madalas, tinatamaan ako ng bola. Kahit malayo pa yon o malapit, sa tingin ko habulin lang talaga
                            ako ng mga bola. O baka, hindi lang ako nakikita ng mga naglalaro dahil para sa kanila, hindi ako nag-eexist. Biglang bumukas ang double doors at pumasok ang anim na lalaki na nakasuot ng basketball uniformm "KYAAAAAAAAAAAA~!"
                            "Andito na sila!" "CHUNJI!! LJOE!! NIEL!!! RICKY!! CAP!! CHANGJO!! ANG HOT NYO!!!" "RICKY!!! PLEASE BE MINE!!" "KYAAAA CHUNNIE IS THE BEST!!" "Shucks! Ang hot nila!!" "KYAAAAAA~ Number 88 marry me!!" sigaw ng nasa unahan ko.
                            Napatingin sa amin ang lalaking may number 88. Hindi pala, sa AKIN sya napatingin. Si Ljoe. Akala kaya nya ako ang sumigaw? Hwag naman sana. *** Uwian. Dadaan na naman ako sa locker ko para iwan ang iba kong gamit. Ayokong
                            dalhin ito sa bahay para lang dalhin ulit kinabukasan. Pero natatakot na akong pumunta sa locker. Hihintayin ko nalang siguro na makauwi na lahat ng estudyante. Nagtago muna ako sa library. Magbabasa nalang siguro muna ako
                            ng libro. Naging mabilis ang oras, alas sais y medya na ng lumabas ako sa library. Mabuti nalang at may meeting ang mga faculty at late uuwi kaya hindi ako na- lock sa loob. Pumunta na ako sa locker ko. Napatigil nalang ako
                            nang makita ko sya. Nakaupo sya sa sahig at nakasandal sa locker nya. Ano'ng ginagawa nya dito? Hindi pa ba sya uuwi? Katulad ng ibang nagdaan na araw para syang may hinihintay. Bakit kaya sya naghihintay sa locker? Wala ba
                            silang ibang pwedeng gaawin na hintayan? Nagpatuloy na ako sa paglalakad. Nakita nya akong palapit kaya agad syang tumayo at inayos ang damit. "Saan ka galing?" Nagulat ako sa tanong nya. Pero mas nagulat ako dahil kinakausap
                            nya ako. Akala ko ba ayaw nya sakin? Palagi nga syang umaalis kapag nakikita nya ako. Hindi ko sya pinansin. Binuksan ko ang locker ko, agad naman nya tong isinara. "Saan ka galing?" ulit nya Kung tignan nya ako parang may
                            napakalaki kong kasalanan sa kanya. Bakit ba? Ano'ng bang nagawa ko? "Sa library.." sagot ko Binuksan ko na ulit yung locker ko at inilagay ang mga gamit ko. "Sigurado kang sa library ka galing?" usisa nya Hindi ko alam kung
                            ano'ng meron at tinatanong nya ako. "Oo nga sabi," mahina kong sagot. "Ano'ng ginawa mo sa library?" "Nagbasa..?" "Sigurado ka? Nagbasa ka lang? Sino ang kasama mo? Lalaki? Sino? Ano'ng section nya?" Isinara ko ang locker ko.
                            "Hindi ako interesado na makipagdate," sagot ko Tinitigan nya ako. "Akala ko ba may boyfriend ka?" Napabuntong hininga nalang ako. "Sinabi ko lang yon para matapos ang usapan. Okay na? Wala ka ng tanong? Pwede na akong umuwi?"
                            "May isa pa akong tanong," lumapit sya sa akin "Ano'ng pangalan mo?" "Bakit ba gusto nyong malaman ang pangalan ko?" buntong hininga ko "Nyo? May iba pang nagtanong sa'yo bukod sa'kin? Sino?" Ang dami nyang tanong. Bumuntong
                            hininga ako. "Yung kasama mo nung sabado ng gabi," sabi ko Natahimik sya. "So you're a gangster.." tinignan ko sya "that's nice" naglakad na ako palayo. Sana naman hwag na syang mangulit. *** Hindi ko na napapanaginipan pa
                            ang lalaking hinahanap ko. Napalitan na sya ng isang makulit na lalaking may dilaw na buhok. Paulit-ulit syang nagtatanong. Paulit ulit nyang tinatanong ang pangalan ko. Hindi na ako nakatulog pagkatapos kong magising ng 3:00AM.
                            Malakas ang ulan sa labas. Lumabas ako ng kwarto at pumunta sa kusina. Nakakita ako ng mangga sa lamesa kung saan kasama ang iba pang prutas. Dilaw. Naalala ko na naman sya. Si Ljoe. Hindi ko alam na hanggang panaginip ay susundan
                            nya ako. Bakit ba nya tinatanong sakin kung ano ang pangalan ko? Hmm... *** Locker. Bago ako pumunta sa locker area nagdasal muna ako na sana hindi sya maaga pumasok. Pinili ko talagang pumasok nang maaga para lang makaiwas
                            sa kanya. Siguro naman ang isang delinquent na katulad nya ay late kung pumasok. Pero bakit ba ako nag-aassume na nandon lang sya para kulitin ako? Hindi naman siguro sya pumupunta don para sa isang katulad ko. Tama. Mabilis
                            akong pumunta sa locker area. At may dalawang tao don. Ang isa ay si Ljoe at ang isa ay kaibigan nya. Sya ang pinaka-palangiti sa grupo. Sa tingin ko, sya ang pinaka-pala- kaibigan. Binuksan ko ang locker ko para kumuha ng
                            gamit. Nang isinara ko na, nagulat ako dahil nakangiti sa akin yung kaibigan ni Ljoe. "Hi ako si Niel, classmate kita sa Foreign Language," nakangiti nyang pakilala. Hindi sya katulad ni Ljoe o ni CAP na hindi ngumingiti. "Oo,
                            natatandaan kita," sagot ko sa kanya. *BAM!* Malakas na sumara ang locker sa likod ko. Pagtingin ko, mukhang hindi maganda ang mood ni Ljoe. "Wow! Natatandaan mo ako!" malapad na ngiti na sabi nya Mukha syang tuwang tuwa, kumikinang
                            ang mga mata nya. Naalala ko ang mga bata sa ampunan, ganon ang mga mata nila sa tuwing nakikita ako. Kaya alam ko na, masaya nga si Niel ngayon. Kung bakit, hindi ko alam. "Sorry ha? Ang totoo nyan, alam ko na halos lahat
                            ng pangalan ng mga kaklase ko yung sa'yo lang ang hindi. Hindi ka kasi tinatawag ng prof o ng mga kaklase natin," naka-pout na sabi nya "Pwede ko bang malaman ang pangalan mo?" Napakurap-kurap ako. Mukha syang puppy. "Juniel,"
                            bigla kong sagot na ikinabigla ko. "Juniel? Ang gandang pangalan! Kung ganon nice to meet you Juniel!" hinawakan nya ang kamay ko at nakipag-shakehands "Pareho tayo, Daniel ako at ikaw Juniel! Nakakatuwa!" "Niel" tawag ni Ljoe
                            Binitawan ni Niel ang kamay ko. "Uh. Sige, kita kits nalang hehe!" tumakbo na paalis si Niel at nang nasa malayo na sya lumingon sya at kumaway Kusa naman napa-angat ang kamay ko, kumaway din ako sa kanya. "TSK!" sabi ng nasa
                            likod ko Ibinaba ko ang kamay ko at napalingon kay Ljoe. Mukhang hindi sya masaya at nakatingin sya sa akin gamit ang matalas nyang tingin. "Bakit mo sinabi ang pangalan mo sa kanya?!" nakasigaw nyang tanong Tinitignan nya
                            ako na parang hindi sya makapaniwala sa ginawa ko, na parang may nilabag akong batas. "Kasi.. tinanong nya?" "At ako hindi ko rin ba itinanong?!" "Bakit ka ba sumisigaw?" Mabuti nalang sobrang aga pa. Wala pang mga estudyante
                            dito. "Type mo ba si Niel?!" "Huh?" "May gusto ka ba sa kaibigan ko?" nagngingitngit nyang tanong Kumurap kurap ako. Seryoso ba sya? Kung titignan, seryoso nga sya. "Cute sya" Natigilan sya. Natigilan din ako sa sagot ko. Pero
                            cute naman talaga si Niel. Mukha syang tuta kanina. At yung buhok nya gulo-gulo, katulad ng mga bata sa ampunan. "Pakiulit ng sinabi mo," utos ni Ljoe sa mababang boses "Cute si Niel" "CUTE?!!! CUTE?!!!" tumalikod sya sakin.
                            "Unbelievable.." bulong nya Mukha syang frustrated. "Cute naman talaga sya eh," bulong ko Tinignan nya ako ng masama. Napatahimik ako. "Pano ako?" "Huh?" "Ano'ng tingin mo sakin?" inilapit nya ang mukha nya "Uhh.." tinignan
                            ko sya "Weirdo?" "WEIRDO?!!" "Ssh! Hwag kang sumigaw!" "Si Niel sinabihan mo ng cute at ang nakuha ko mula sa'yo, weirdo?" "Kulay yellow ang buhok mo, ang tingkad! Mukha kang krayola." Napatakip ako sa bibig ko. Nilait ko sya.
                            Patay. Mas lalo nya akong hindi titigilan. *** Martes. Isang linggo ang nakalipas, hindi ko na ulit nakausap pa si Ljoe o kung sino man sa mga kaibigan nya. Nagpapasalamat ako sa mga nangyayari pero.. Parang palagi nalang may
                            kulang sa araw ko. Naglalakad ako para sa grocery shopping. Wala akong pasok ngayong araw dahil free day ng klase para sa thesis. Hindi ko dala ang kotse ko ngayon since coding. Ang payapa ng araw ko ngayon. Sobrang tahimik.
                            Ganito naman talaga dapat ang buhay ko ngayon. Dapat tahimik, dapat masaya ako pero.. bakit ako nalulungkot? Nadaanan ko ang children's park. Walang mga bata, sa tingin ko dahil yon sa naganap na kidnapping nung nakaraang bwan.
                            Kaya wala nang pumupunta dito. Lalagpasan ko na sana ang park nang makita ko ang isang pamilyar na lalaki. Kahit saan talaga sya pumunta, mahihirapan syang magtago sa tingkad ng kulay ng buhok nya. Mag-isa syang nakaupo sa
                            bench. Nakayuko. Kung titignan sa malayo, mukha syang malungkot. Puntahan ko kaya? Hindi pwede, baka kulitin nya ulit ako kapag kinausap ko sya. Mas makabubuti sa akin na makaiwas sa atensyon ng mga tao. Marami ang nagkakagusto
                            sa kanya, kapag lumapit ako siguradong makakakuha ako ng atensyon sa school. Mas gusto kong panatilihin ang status ko ngayon. Invisible. Dumiretso na ako sa grocery. *** Malakas ang buhos ng ulan nang matapos akong mamili.
                            Mabuti nalang at nakapagdala ako ng payong, alam ko kasing mangyayari ito. Kahit papano, na-warningan na ako kanina sa panaginip ko. Mas naging madalang para sa akin ang makita ang hinaharap. Hindi ko alam kung bakit, nawawala
                            na kaya ang kakayanan ko? Habang naglalakad napatingin ulit ako sa park. Automatic nalang akong napatingin sa kinauupuan nya. "Bakit nandon parin sya?" tanong ko sa sarili ko nang makita parin sya don Nakaupo lang sya, nakayuko
                            at walang pakialam kahit na nababasa na sya ng ulan. Mabilis akong tumawid sa kalsada at lumapit sa kanya.

                            <p class="ellipsis" style="-webkit-line-clamp: 25;">&nbsp;</p>
                            Pinayungan ko sya. Agad syang napatingin sa akin. "Ano ba?! Gusto mo bang magkasakit? Kayong mga lalaki, kung umasta kayo parang ang lakas lakas nyo! Nagkakasakit din kayo no!" Tumayo sya at inayos ang hawak ko sa payong, inilipat nya sakin. "Dumating
                            ka," sabi nya. Mukhang hindi nya ine-expect. "Y-Yung buhok mo.." bulong ko Namilog ang mga mata ko. "Tama ka, weirdo nga ako. Ang buhok ko kapag nababasa ng ulan, nagiging brown." Brown. Kulay Golden Brown. "Ikaw..sya.." Sa
                            unang pagkakataon, lumiwanag ang mukha nya at ngumiti sya. Bumilis ang pintig ng puso ko. "Akala ko sa panaginip lang kita makikita," sabi nya Nagtaka ako. Panaginip. "Mahirap paniwalaan, pero alam ko," hinawakan nya ang pisngi
                            ko "Para ka sa'kin" Nabitawan ko ang payong na hawak ko. Ito ang nasa panaginip ko. Bakit hindi ko napansin agad? Matagal na pala syang dumating sa buhay ko. Ang lalaking hinanap ko nang matagal. Hindi ko man lang sya napansin.
                            "Alam ko, naghintay din ako." Napuno ng saya ang puso ko nang sa wakas ay masabi nya ang dalawang salita na kukumpleto sakin. "You're mine" ***~@#@~***##***~@#@~*** End.
